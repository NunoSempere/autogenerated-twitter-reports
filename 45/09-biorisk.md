Direct answer (one-line): Last week’s biorisk news was dominated by a large, geographically widespread surge in avian influenza (H5N1) affecting wild birds, commercial poultry and some mammals (with new signals about animal-to-human interfaces), continued major infectious-disease outbreaks in several regions (Lassa, Rift Valley fever, dengue, measles, cholera, polio), notable vaccine and therapeutic trial results (including a promising Lassa vaccine phase 1 readout and intranasal H5 candidate data), and persistent concerns about antimicrobial resistance and surveillance gaps.

Key themes and topics
- Avian influenza (H5N1): Multiple new outbreaks across North America, Europe and Asia in commercial poultry, wild birds and some mammals; large poultry losses reported (e.g., a 113,000-bird turkey farm in Michigan) and repeated USDA/WOAH notifications of infected commercial flocks in the US, Canada, UK, France, Netherlands, Japan and elsewhere [example US commercial outbreaks and multisite reports](https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1986852889839411444) and [USDA/Indiana detections](https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1986880808297152920). Surveillance/virology signals included detection of influenza A in milk from affected dairies (preprint) and reports about a cattle-derived H5N1 isolate with concerning properties in organoid studies, both of which increase attention on cross‑species transmission and food‑chain risks ([milk preprint](https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1985818548984250703); [discussion of a cattle-derived isolate](https://x.com/DaniBeckman/status/1986958972314918918)).

- Human infections, surveillance & transparency: Reports and studies continued to show human exposure/asymptomatic infections with avian viruses and calls for robust genomic and clinical surveillance. Some commentary flagged concerns about data release and surveillance capacity. An analysis showing asymptomatic human H5N1 infections was highlighted in the discussion of surveillance sensitivity [as discussed here](https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1984709957586162062).

- Vaccines and therapeutics: Positive early-phase Lassa vaccine results (rVSV platform) showed acceptable safety and immunogenicity in US and Liberia trial participants (NEJM/CIDRAP coverage) [NEJM summary](https://x.com/NEJM/status/1986886494855045605) / [CIDRAP report](https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1986896408494944656). An intranasal H5 vaccine provoked mucosal and systemic responses in phase 1 testing [CIDRAP summary](https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1986546257414775269). Other therapeutics data included phase 2 antiviral data for ensitrelvir against early COVID-19 [CIDRAP report](https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1985828203957481774), and RSV prevention durability questions for nirsevimab [CIDRAP coverage](https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1986880511399072188).

- Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) & health systems: High rates of multidrug-resistant bacterial isolates were reported from West Bank hospitals (large sample) raising regional AMR concerns [CIDRAP coverage](https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1986550942712443388). AfricaCDC continued to emphasize continental AMR planning and One Health/ genomic surveillance investments ([AfricaCDC genomic surveillance for malaria](https://x.com/AfricaCDC/status/1987097910543057057)).

- Other outbreak hotspots: Rising Lassa fever mortality in Nigeria, expanding Rift Valley fever counts in Senegal/Mauritania, substantial dengue deaths/cases in Bangladesh, measles outbreaks threatening elimination status in parts of the Americas and local measles clusters in multiple countries, cholera resurgence in Haiti and poliovirus (cVDPV1) detections in Laos — all underlined weakening routine immunization and health-system stresses (examples: [Rift Valley fever update](https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1986886278609014994), [Lassa toll in Nigeria](https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1986275855786823978), and Americas measles risk commentary [STAT](https://x.com/statnews/status/1985435799798661341)).

Notable patterns and trends relevant to biorisk
- Geographic breadth and multispecies spread of H5N1: H5N1 detections were reported in many countries and in diverse hosts (wild birds, commercial poultry, backyard flocks, zoo collections, and occasional mammals), indicating wide environmental circulation and repeated spillover events; mandatory housing orders and widespread culling/housing guidance were issued in some countries ([UK/England housing order example](https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1985341526516326875)).

- Increasing attention to zoonotic interfaces and food-chain risk: Reports of viral material in dairy (bulk-tank/pen-level milk preprint) and animal isolates able to replicate in human organoids raised questions about food-safety and on-farm biosecurity ([milk detection preprint](https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1985818548984250703)).

- Continued gaps in routine immunization and the re-emergence of vaccine-preventable disease: Measles outbreaks (Canada, US pockets, Africa) and polio vaccine-derived detections emphasize the consequences when coverage drops or conflict/displacement disrupts services ([Canada/Américas elimination concern](https://x.com/statnews/status/1985435799798661341)).

- Active vaccine and therapeutic development pipeline: Encouraging early-phase results for Lassa and intranasal avian flu vaccine candidates, and ongoing antiviral and monoclonal antibody evaluations, show progress in countermeasures but also highlight access and equity concerns (WHO/CIDRAP noted need to plan for equitable TB vaccine access as an analogy) [WHO/CIDRAP vaccine-access discussion](https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1986552925687058568).

- AMR as a persistent systemic risk: Large hospital surveillance datasets and continent-level AMR planning underscore that drug-resistant pathogens remain a major biorisk that complicates outbreak response.

Significant events / developments (each given a short focused paragraph)
1) Global H5N1 expansion and multispecies detections: Last week saw an intensification of H5N1 reports across continents — repeated detections in commercial poultry, wild birds and some mammals, with major farm culls and mandatory biosecurity measures in several countries. The breadth of events (US commercial flocks in multiple states, European farm and wild-bird detections, Canadian commercial farm reports) and ancillary signals (viral RNA in milk from affected dairies, organoid studies of cattle‑derived isolates, and documented asymptomatic human infections) together represent an elevated zoonotic biorisk that requires heightened surveillance, stronger farm biosecurity, and careful monitoring of human exposure pathways ([CIDRAP summary of multiple outbreaks](https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1986852889839411444); [milk preprint](https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1985818548984250703); [FluTrackers cattle-derived commentary](https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1985346905501471021)).

2) Lassa vaccine phase 1 success and intranasal H5 vaccine signal: Early clinical results for an rVSV‑vectored Lassa vaccine showed no serious adverse events and robust immune responses in a US/Liberia phase 1 trial — an important milestone for a virus that causes yearly outbreaks in West Africa and large mortality in 2025 ([NEJM coverage](https://x.com/NEJM/status/1986886494855045605); [CIDRAP report](https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1986896408494944656)). In parallel, a phase 1 intranasal H5 candidate elicited mucosal and systemic immunity, which is noteworthy for future pandemic preparedness for avian influenza strains ([CIDRAP intranasal H5 summary](https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1986546257414775269)).

3) Regional outbreak clusters undermining control and stressing systems: Multiple simultaneous outbreaks (Lassa in Nigeria, Rift Valley fever in Senegal/Mauritania, dengue in Bangladesh with high deaths, measles resurgences threatening elimination in parts of the Americas, polio vaccine-derived detections in Laos, cholera re-emergence in Haiti) illustrate how gaps in vaccination, conflict, displacement and strained health systems amplify biorisk and complicate responses (examples: [Rift Valley fever updates](https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1986886278609014994); [Lassa in Nigeria](https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1986275855786823978); [statnews on measles elimination risk](https://x.com/statnews/status/1985435799798661341)).

Bottom-line implications and near-term priorities
- Maintain and scale multisector surveillance (animal, farm, human) and genomic sequencing to detect and characterize avian influenza spillovers and to track evolution; monitor food‑chain samples (milk, dairy) where indicated.
- Accelerate targeted vaccination/therapeutic development plans while planning for equitable access and manufacturing scale-up (Lassa, H5 candidates, RSV monoclonals), and continue robust safety monitoring for novel therapeutics (CRISPR trial pause reminder). 
- Strengthen routine immunization and outbreak response capacity to prevent secondary epidemics of measles, polio, cholera and dengue in vulnerable/conflict-affected settings.
- Address AMR through stewardship, laboratory strengthening and funding for national AMR plans.
