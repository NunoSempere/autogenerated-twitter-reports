Також били по Дніпровщині, Кіровоградщині, Миколаївщині, Сумщині, Чернігівщині.

Понад 450 ударних дронів і 45 ракет різних типів випустила Росія по Україні. І цілі в терористів незмінні: звичайне життя, житлові будинки, наша енергетика, інфраструктура.\n\nПитання в ресурсах на вбивства, у грошах – потрібні санкції, щоб позбавити Росію можливості продовжувати війну, яку вона почала і затягує. Цінуємо всі кроки, які партнери вже зробили, але російські удари показують, що тиск має бути сильнішим. Обовʼязково має бути європейське рішення по російських заморожених активах, додаткові санкції, підтримка і посилення захисту України. І на кожен удар Москви по енергетиці, яким вони хочуть нашкодити звичайним людям перед зимою, має бути санкційна відповідь по всій російській енергетиці без винятків. Досі не під санкціями атомна енергетика Росії, досі російський ВПК отримує західну мікроелектроніку, більше тиску має бути й по торгівлі нафтою та газом.

Tragically, one life was also lost in the Kharkiv region, and people were also injured in the Kyiv and Poltava regions. There were also strikes in the Dnipro, Kirovohrad, Mykolaiv, Sumy, and Chernihiv regions. The Odesa region has been under attack since the evening.\n\nAll relevant services are deployed wherever required – restoring facilities after the strikes, supporting people, and aiding the injured. Russia launched over 450 attack drones and 45 missiles of various types against Ukraine. And the terrorists’ targets remain unchanged: civilian life, residential buildings, our energy sector, and infrastructure.\n\nThis is a matter of resources for killing, of money – sanctions are needed to deprive Russia of the means to continue the war it started and keeps prolonging. We appreciate all the steps partners have already taken, but Russian strikes show that pressure must be intensified. There must be a European decision on Russia’s frozen assets, additional sanctions, and support and reinforcement for Ukraine’s defense. And for every Moscow’s strike on energy infrastructure – aimed at harming ordinary people before winter – there must be a sanctions response targeting all Russian energy, with no exceptions. So far, Russia’s nuclear energy sector is not under sanctions, and the Russian military-industrial complex still obtains Western microelectronics. There must be greater pressure on its oil and gas trade as well. We expect relevant decisions from the United States, Europe, and the G7.

The windfall prompted accusations that Norway became a \"war profiteer\" - and now several Norwegian parties argue Oslo has a moral obligation to help unlock EU funding for Ukraine.\n\nThe EU's proposed loan would use €190-210 billion in frozen Russian assets held in Europe as collateral. Belgium's legal objections to the scheme have stalled the plan. Norwegian opposition leaders say their country's €1.8 trillion sovereign wealth fund gives it the financial strength to guarantee part of the loan and break the impasse.\n\nThe debate draws Europe's wealthiest energy producer deeper into discussions on funding Ukraine's defense as the EU looks for ways to meet Kyiv's €55 billion funding needs for the next two years.\n\n🔗Read more: https://t.co/29AtyDqO6V\n\n📷Ukrainian President’s Office, 2022",

My understanding is that the pipeline from Croatia can provide all of Hungary's energy needs.\nAs a result, why would you need an exemption if that's the case? \n\n[PM Orban]:\nSo when we discuss that issue, you should separate the gas and the oil. On the gas issue, we have only one pipeline delivering gas to Hungary, which is the main pipeline, the Turkish one.\nWhat we got from Croatia is a very small volume supplementary gas pipeline. \n\nOil is another issue.\n\nSo  oil is coming from the Druzhba pipeline, which is the main supply, and there is a Croatian one, which is the secondary and supplementary pipeline. We would like to convince the Croatian government to enlarge it and make it possible to deliver more. Under the circumstances, it cannot be the main pipeline.\nIt's just supplementary.

Russian \"tourism\" companies have essentially become recruitment agencies for war - and, in most cases, it’s a one-way ticket.\n\nContract military service in the Russian army is becoming increasingly popular among Iraqi citizens. The conditions offered by the Russian military seem attractive - Iraqis are promised salaries of up to $2,800 per month, which is about four times higher than the average income in Iraq, as well as a one-time payment of up to $20,000 for signing a contract.\n\nOffers being circulated on platforms like TikTok and Telegram include substantial monetary compensation, a sign-up fee, insurance, pension options, and even Russian citizenship.\n\nMoreover, recruitment is often framed as a \"job opportunity\" rather than an explicit war contract: some recruits are told they’ll serve in support roles (drivers, cooks, logistics) but end up in combat on the front line with little support.\n\nFamilies of recruits often lose contact with them; many recruits are reported missing, injured, killed or returned in body bags.\n\nSome vivid cases:\n\n▪️ The last TikTok post of a young Iraqi man, Mohammed Imad, 24, showed him in military gear beside a Russian flag. He asked viewers to \"pray for me\" - and has not been heard from since. Shortly before that he had travelled to Russia without his family’s knowledge, enlisting to fight for Russia’s armed forces.\n\n▪️ Alawi Motlak, 30, travelled to Russia with Mohammed in April. Both of them went missing in May. Before he disappeared, Alawi sent his family pictures of himself sitting in a bunker with Mohammed in military fatigues, or training together near Bakhmut, eastern Ukraine. In one video, Alawi thanked Abbas al-Manasir for helping them get to Russia.\n\n▪️ Abbas Hamdallah, known on social media as \"Abbas al-Manasir,\" is among many Iraqis who share their experiences in the Russian army on TikTok and Telegram and offer help to those who want to enlist. He joined the Russian army in 2024 and now has a Russian passport.\n\nAl-Manasir was recruited into the Russian army after scanning a QR-code ad in Moscow that promised high pay and quick enlistment. Along with several friends, he signed a contract, went through a month of military and language training, and was then sent to fight in Bakhmut. Alongside Iraqis, there were many Egyptians and Algerians.\n\nAbbas later shared videos warning others that joining the war \"carries a 99% chance of death.\" He estimated that around 1,000 Iraqis have joined Russian forces since 2022, with up to 200 killed.\n\nSources: https://t.co/NWF00uxbww\n https://t.co/3eAt1K2dE1",

Ukraine and partners report roughly 450 strike drones and 45 missiles used in the attack; Ukraine’s air defenses and mobile units reportedly neutralized the vast majority of the drones (Zelenskyy: ~406/458 drones shot down; other reporting: 450+ drones and 45 missiles) and shot down some missiles, but strikes caused civilian casualties, building collapses, fires, and extensive power outages across multiple regions including Dnipro, Kharkiv, Kyiv, Poltava and others ([ZelenskyyUa](https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1987071260082216970); [NOELreports](https://x.com/NOELreports/status/1987078282383126548); [NOELreports Dnipro strike](https://x.com/NOELreports/status/1987078938649059636)).\n\nKey themes and topics related to the question:\n\n- Mass drone warfare and strikes on energy/civilian infrastructure: Moscow’s recent tactic has focused on energy, gas and urban targets to cause blackouts and civilian disruption ahead of winter; Ukrainian leaders and Air Force spokespeople framed many of these attacks as deliberate terrorism against civilian life and infrastructure ([NOELreports — energy focus](https://x.com/NOELreports/status/1987137178502054366); [ZelenskyyUa](https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1987071260082216970)).\n\n- Ukraine’s growing unmanned/drone capabilities and counter‑drone measures: Ukraine is scaling domestic Mavic-style production and mass-producing strike drones, expanding unmanned air-defense capability (appointment of a Commander of Unmanned Air Defence Systems), and fielding indigenous and allied low-cost AD systems (British Raven, STING etc.) to intercept cruise missiles and Shahed drones ([ZelenskyyUa — appointment](https://x.com/NOELreports/status/1987136447141355639); [wartranslated / Raven intercepts](https://x.com/wartranslated/status/1987128327916958083); [EuromaidanPress drone mass‑prod.](https://x.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1986933686873305311)).\n\n- Ukrainian strikes deeper into Russian-held/ Russian territory and Crimea: Ukraine continues to hit infrastructure and military targets inside Russia and occupied Crimea — substations, fuel depots, and even an S-400 TEL and ammo depot in Crimea credited to SOF/SSO operations — demonstrating increased Ukrainian deep-strike and SOF reach ([Gerashchenko_en S-400/Cimea](https://x.com/Gerashchenko_en/status/1987116861469643158); [Osinttechnical footage](https://x.com/Osinttechnical/status/1987097347638059063); [wartranslated — substations hit](https://x.com/wartranslated/status/1987094698998014021)).\n\n- Allied hardware and procurement debates: Ukraine is seeking more long-range air‑defense and strike systems (Patriot requests; Tomahawk discussion pending U.S. presidential approval), allies are delivering and developing systems (Sweden funding long‑range strike drones; UK Raven system successes; UK Ajax deliveries to NATO eastern flank), and the United States and some NATO partners are stepping up material support while others push for political or legal solutions to fund Ukraine’s needs ([NOELreports — Patriots/Tomahawks](https://x.com/NOELreports/status/1987138672035004881); [Mylovanov on Ajax](https://x.com/Mylovanov/status/1987143704247755205); [NOELreports — Sweden drones](https://x.com/NOELreports/status/1986818821710037277); [Osinttechnical Raven footage](https://x.com/Osinttechnical/status/1986930861963673939)).\n\n- Political divergence within NATO/EU and bilateral politics: Allies are split on methods and policy. The U.S. has publicly backed using frozen Russian assets as a funding tool for Ukraine, but the plan faces legal and political resistance in Europe (Belgium concerns, Slovakia/Slovak PM Fico opposing), and Hungary secured a U.S. one‑year exemption to keep importing Russian oil—moves that complicate unified EU/NATO responses ([Reuters / US backs frozen assets](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1986937989402861599); [NOELreports — Belgium/asset issues](https://x.com/NOELreports/status/1987138498797658354); [wartranslated / Hungary exemption](https://x.com/wartranslated/status/1987110740684111956); [NOELreports on Hungary exemption](https://x.com/NOELreports/status/1987069618813329773)).\n\nNotable patterns and trends relevant to the question:\n\n- Escalation of drone-led campaigns: Both sides increasingly rely on swarms (Russia: mass Shahed/loitering drones; Ukraine: FPV and guided strike drones). This has shifted the fight toward attrition, low-cost unmanned strikes, and rapid countermeasure development (interceptor drones, EW, low-cost SAMs) ([Gerashchenko_en mass attack summary](https://x.com/Gerashchenko_en/status/1987083504681705649); [bayraktar_1love STING footage](https://x.com/bayraktar_1love/status/1986795222961918040)).\n\n- Strategic focus on energy and logistics: Russia’s recent wave targeted Ukraine’s energy and transport hubs to inflict civilian hardship; Ukraine responded with strikes on Russian power substations and fuel depots — both sides increasingly attack the other’s logistics, energy and economic infrastructure ([NOELreports — energy outages](https://x.com/NOELreports/status/1987069859675709899); [wartranslated Russian grid strikes](https://x.com/wartranslated/status/1987094698998014021); [EuromaidanPress on Russian nodes hit](https://x.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1986941242404417561)).\n\n- Political fragmentation among NATO/EU partners: There is growing divergence (e.g., Hungary’s exemption and insistence on different approach; Belgium’s legal reservations over frozen asset use; Slovakia’s PM opposition) that complicates a single unified EU/NATO approach to funding and sanctions, even as many NATO members expand military aid ([NOELreports on Fico](https://x.com/NOELreports/status/1987160441026490812); [NOELreports on Belgium/EU assets](https://x.com/NOELreports/status/1987134718848954721); [wartranslated on Hungary exemption](https://x.com/wartranslated/status/1987110740684111956)).\n\n- NATO deterrence posture and warning signals: NATO allies are conducting nuclear drills and exercises and senior NATO/European officials have publicly warned about Russia’s potential to threaten NATO territory; military planners are rehearsing defensive scenarios beyond Ukraine’s borders ([Reuters — Rutte on nuclear drills](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1987144352229945385); [Reuters / German general warning](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1986780946557780051); [POLITICOEurope coverage](https://x.com/POLITICOEurope/status/1986817727814607029)).\n\nImportant mentions, interactions, and data points (selected):\n\n- Strike numbers and air defense performance: Ukraine reports ~406–458 drones intercepted and 9/45 missiles shot down in the overnight campaign; 26 missiles penetrated and hit inside Ukraine ([NOELreports on interceptions](https://x.com/NOELreports/status/1987078282383126548)).\n\n- Civilian toll and infrastructure damage: Multiple residential buildings struck (large apartment building in Dnipro with deaths and injuries; other fatalities/injuries across regions), long power outages and disrupted rail services after attacks on depots and substations ([NOELreports Dnipro](https://x.com/NOELreports/status/1987078938649059636); [NOELreports railway depot Hrebinka](https://x.com/NOELreports/status/1987132788022317465)).\n\n- Ukrainian offensive/strike results inside Russia and Crimea: Ukrainian units (SSO/SOF) claim destruction of an S-400 TEL and ammunition depot in Crimea (Uyutne, Udachne) and successful strikes on Russian power/fuel infrastructure in Russia and occupied areas ([Gerashchenko_en S-400 & ammo depot](https://x.com/Gerashchenko_en/status/1987116861469643158); [Osinttechnical FP-2 footage](https://x.com/Osinttechnical/status/1987097347638059063); [wartranslated — substations struck](https://x.com/wartranslated/status/1987094698998014021)).\n\n- Reported casualty and attrition figures: Ukraine’s General Staff/associated reporters cite large Russian losses in recent operations and offensives (examples: Ukraine estimates ~210,000 Russian casualties during a summer offensive in Bakhmut region per one report; daily/unitized losses also reported by NOELreports as +1,190 personnel and hundreds of UAVs lost in a single reporting period — these figures vary by source and are often labeled operational or battlefield tallies) ([Mylovanov on Bakhmut casualties](https://x.com/Mylovanov/status/1987162075211166175); [NOELreports loss list](https://x.com/NOELreports/status/1987067648228614181)).\n\n- Weapon system debates and potential transfers: U.S. technical checks for Tomahawk transfers reportedly completed but require presidential approval; Zelensky and Ukrainian officials are pushing for more Patriots and long-range strike options as part of partner support ([EuromaidanPress on Tomahawks/Pentagon checks](https://x.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1986941242404417561); [NOELreports Tomahawks comment](https://x.com/NOELreports/status/1987154439816548714)).\n\nSignificant events/developments (short focused paragraphs):\n\n1) Massive overnight drone + missile strike on Ukraine and Ukraine’s air‑defense response:\nRussia launched a large coordinated strike (reported ~450 attack drones + 45 missiles) that hit multiple Ukrainian regions, targeted energy infrastructure and residential areas, and caused deaths, injuries and widespread blackouts; Ukraine reports a high interception rate (hundreds of drones shot down), but significant damage and humanitarian impacts remain. These attacks further underline how drone swarm tactics and strikes on civilian infrastructure have become central features of the current campaign ([ZelenskyyUa confirmation and appeals for more air defense](https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1987071260082216970); [NOELreports on interceptions and impacts](https://x.com/NOELreports/status/1987078282383126548)).\n\n2) Ukraine’s deep strikes into Russian territory and SOF strikes in Crimea (S‑400 and ammo depot):\nUkrainian Special Operations / deep-strike units have claimed successful strikes on Russian military assets in Crimea (destruction of an S-400 TEL and an ammunition depot) and multiple attacks on Russian substations and fuel depots across Russian regions and occupied territory, showing an ongoing ability to project force deep into enemy logistics hubs and degrade Russia’s rear infrastructure ([Gerashchenko_en on Crimea S‑400](https://x.com/Gerashchenko_en/status/1987116861469643158); [Osinttechnical FP‑2 footage](https://x.com/Osinttechnical/status/1987097347638059063); [wartranslated on Russian substations](https://x.com/wartranslated/status/1987094698998014021)).\n\n3) Political split over frozen Russian assets, sanctions and energy exemptions affecting NATO/EU cohesion:\nThe U.S. has publicly backed using frozen Russian assets to fund Ukraine, but EU progress is stalled by legal and political objections (notably in Belgium), while Hungary obtained a U.S. exemption to keep importing Russian oil for a year and Slovakia’s PM publicly opposed the EU frozen-assets plan. These fractures complicate a unified Western financial/political strategy even as military aid continues to flow from many partners ([Reuters / US backs frozen assets](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1986937989402861599); [NOELreports on Belgium and frozen assets](https://x.com/NOELreports/status/1987134718848954721); [wartranslated / Hungary exemption](https://x.com/wartranslated/status/1987110740684111956); [NOELreports on Fico](https://x.com/NOELreports/status/1987160441026490812)).\n\nBottom line / implications for NATO countries’ actions: NATO members and partners are increasing military support (AD systems, strike drones, logistics and R&D) while simultaneously facing political friction over sanctions, energy exemptions and funding mechanisms. NATO officials are also publicly signaling increased deterrence preparedness. The war’s character continues to be dominated by massed drone attacks, counter‑drone innovations, and reciprocal strikes on energy/logistics networks — driving Ukraine’s urgent requests for more long‑range air defenses and strike options and pushing partners to balance military aid with fractured geopolitical and legal calculations."
