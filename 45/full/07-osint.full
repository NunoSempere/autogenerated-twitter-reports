And we’re on your team!” Sullivan told Austin J. Dahmer, the nominee for Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy, Plans, and Capabilities. \n\nDahmer was later asked by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), why the Policy Office under Colby had been the center of so many controversies, listing several, including: the several pauses in security assistance to Ukraine, the uncoordinated review of the AUKUS Agreement, opposition to deploying additional American troops to the Middle East during the Iran-Israel War in June, the cancellation of a meeting among top U.S. and Japanese defense officials, and the recent announced withdrawal of a rotational brigade with the U.S. Army deployed to Romania. Dahmer blamed “fake news” and “inaccurate reporting” while feigning ignorance on other issues, incorrectly stating that Congress had been briefed several times on the withdrawal from Romania.\n\n“I understand that media reports can be wrong, believe me, but it just seems like there's this pigpen-like mess coming out of the policy shop that you don't see from, say, intel and security and acquisition and sustainment,” said Cotton, with Sen. Jack Reed (D-RI) telling Dahmer, “My impression today is you cloaked your testimony in a veil of ignorance. You don't know what's happened in many different cases, when in fact, you were basically the stand-in and the surrogate for Secretary Colby.”",

History will remember him as among the finest public servants of his generation – a patriot who brought integrity, high intelligence, and seriousness of purpose to every position he held.\n\nAs a young White House aide and chief of staff, a Congressman, a Secretary of Defense, and my Vice President, Dick earned the confidence and high opinion of five presidents. I asked him to join my ticket in 2000 after first enlisting him to help me find the best running mate. In our long discussions about the qualities a vice president should have – deep experience, mature judgment, character, loyalty – I realized that Dick Cheney was the one I needed. I’m still grateful that he was at my side for the eight years that followed. \n \nDick was a calm and steady presence in the White House amid great national challenges. I counted on him for his honest, forthright counsel, and he never failed to give his best. He held to his convictions and prioritized the freedom and security of the American people. For those two terms in office, and throughout his remarkable career, Dick Cheney’s service always reflected credit on the country he loved.\n \nDick’s love for America was second only to his family.  Laura and I have shared our deepest sympathies with Vice President Cheney’s wife Lynne and their daughters and grandchildren of whom he was so deeply proud. We are praying for Lynne, Liz, Mary, and the Cheney family as they honor a great man.",

      "summary": "Direct answer\nOSINT reporting over the last 24–72 hours shows a sharp intensification in kinetic and infrastructure-focused operations across the Russo‑Ukrainian theater (deep strikes into Russia and concentrated interdiction of Ukrainian logistics), sustained high-volume Russian stand‑off attacks on Ukrainian population centers and infrastructure, demonstrable Ukrainian use of new/indigenous air‑defense and attack drone systems, a major U.S. military posture shift toward the Southern Caribbean amid preparations for possible operations tied to Venezuela, and several high‑profile civilian and humanitarian incidents (a large UPS cargo‑plane crash in Louisville; a worsening water emergency in Tehran; mass‑casualty reporting from Sudan). Examples and primary OSINT posts are linked inline below (representative tweets used as sources).\n\nKey themes and topics\n- Cross‑border infrastructure targeting: frequent Ukrainian strikes on Russian refineries, substations and fuel depots (e.g., Kstovo, Sterlitamak, Volgograd, Tuapse) and reciprocal Russian strikes deep into Ukraine (power, residential, rail hubs). See examples: Sterlitamak strike (OSINT summary) (https://x.com/wartranslated/status/1986760324817588525) and Kstovo/Kstovo refinery footage (https://x.com/Osinttechnical/status/1985708204521898168).\n- Logistics interdiction: rail junctions, repair depots and locomotives targeted to degrade frontline sustainment (e.g., reported destruction of a Kyiv–Poltava railway junction and multiple locomotives) (https://x.com/Schizointel/status/1987166705563390389; https://x.com/Schizointel/status/1986441851499618721).\n- High‑volume drone/missile salvos and air‑defense engagements: Russia reportedly launched multi‑hundred drone waves and dozens of cruise missiles; Ukrainian forces and new systems (including UK‑engineered Raven SAM) have begun shooting down cruise missiles and Shahed drones (https://x.com/wartranslated/status/1987154407155536059; https://x.com/Osinttechnical/status/1986930861963673939).\n- Deep‑strike reach, attrition of Russian industrial/energy nodes: multiple attacks on refineries, petrochemical plants and high‑voltage substations indicate growing Ukrainian reach into Russia’s rear areas (examples above and https://x.com/Osinttechnical/status/1986552882988974461).\n- Western military posture and regional crises: concentrated US carrier/air assets and radar deployments in the Southern Caribbean/rookeries (Roosevelt Roads, Ceiba, B‑52s on station) tied to contingency planning concerning Venezuela (https://x.com/sentdefender/status/1985477303162331249; https://x.com/MT_Anderson/status/1985702765264269368).\n- Non‑combat humanitarian/security crises: major civil aircraft crash with large fire and casualties in Louisville (UPS Flight 2976); Iran’s capital water reserves precipitously low; reports of mass atrocities and mass graves in Sudan’s RSF‑controlled areas (see below links).\n\nNotable patterns and trends\n- Stepped‑up mutual targeting of logistics/energy nodes: both sides focus on denying mobility/energy rather than only tactical front‑line attrition. Multiple rail and fuel infrastructure strikes have the tactical aim of choking resupply lines.\n- Increasing depth and tempo of Ukrainian raids into Russian territory: sustained drone attacks on refineries, substations and ports (Kstovo, Sterlitamak, Volgograd, Tuapse) show operational reach beyond frontline areas.\n- Mass drone salvos as regular doctrine: Russia’s use of hundreds of strike drones in single operations is recurring; interception rates reported variably and remain a key limiter of civilian harm. See reported scale: ~450 drones + 45 missiles (https://x.com/wartranslated/status/1987154407155536059).\n- Proliferation of low‑cost tactical solutions and improvised air defense: fielded Raven SAMs, FPV/attack drones and suicide drones are shaping battlespace effects and causing asymmetric losses (https://x.com/Osinttechnical/status/1986930861963673939; https://x.com/Osinttechnical/status/1985483112646647840).\n- Regional security flashpoints driven by great‑power signaling: U.S. strike‑capable assets concentrated off Venezuela and NATO concern about drone incursions over European airfields suggest risk of crises spillover and signaling escalations.\n\nImportant mentions, interactions and data points (selected)\n- Russia reportedly launched a very large strike: \"over 450\" strike drones and 45 missiles; OSINT reporting cites civilian casualties and damage in multiple oblasts (https://x.com/wartranslated/status/1987154407155536059).\n- Ukrainian/Russian logistics hits: an important Kyiv–Poltava railway junction was reported destroyed and locomotive/repair depots hit; independent OSINT posts claim dozens of locomotives damaged or burned (example posts) (https://x.com/Schizointel/status/1987166705563390389; https://x.com/Schizointel/status/1987166946140537243; https://x.com/Schizointel/status/1986441851499618721).\n- Ukrainian air‑defense/attack successes: first released footage of British‑designed \"Raven\" system in Ukrainian service engaging Kh‑59 and Kh‑101 cruise missiles (https://x.com/wartranslated/status/1987128327916958083; https://x.com/Osinttechnical/status/1986930861963673939).\n- Damage to Russian oil/energy infrastructure (representative examples): Volgograd Lukoil refinery shut down after strike (https://x.com/Osinttechnical/status/1986552882988974461); Kstovo refinery emergency flare and reported damage (https://x.com/Osinttechnical/status/1985708204521898168); Tuapse marine oil terminal hit/damaged (https://x.com/wartranslated/status/1985301608733819007).\n- Significant ground fighting and territorial pressure: persistent Russian advances/BAI (battle‑air‑interdiction) effects in the Pokrovsk area with heavy combat and localized encirclement risk reported (https://x.com/criticalthreats/status/1986997449240813864).\n- NATO/EU airspace incidents: Belgian airspace closures and airport suspensions after multiple unidentified drone incursions; NATO/Belgian sources suspect state actors (https://x.com/Osinttechnical/status/1985806210164006935; https://x.com/sentdefender/status/1986616845265478091).\n- U.S. regional posture: Carrier and long‑range bomber activity plus forward radar/tactical assets deployed in the Southern Caribbean and Puerto Rico area; reporting highlights USS Gerald R. Ford movements and forward airbase preparations (https://x.com/sentdefender/status/1985477303162331249; https://x.com/MT_Anderson/status/1985702765264269368).\n- Civilian catastrophe & accident: UPS Flight 2976 (MD‑11F) crashed after takeoff from Louisville; extensive video, satellite and recorder recovery reporting and rising death toll (https://x.com/sentdefender/status/1986239536138170543; https://x.com/Osinttechnical/status/1985883276389556314).\n- Environmental / humanitarian: Satellite imagery analysis indicates Tehran’s reservoirs have lost ~19.4 km² of water since 2020; local authorities warn of imminent severe shortages and possible evacuation steps (https://x.com/FaytuksNetwork/status/1987081884912791633).\n- Human rights / atrocity reporting: geolocated reporting and satellite imagery show mass graves, mass‑casualty scenes and alleged systematic killings in RSF‑controlled areas of Sudan (see Bellingcat/OSINT thread) (https://x.com/Schizointel/status/1986115671416050100).\n\nFocused summaries of highly significant developments (one paragraph each)\n1) Russia’s large overnight drone + missile strikes on Ukraine\nOSINT accounts report an exceptionally large Russian salvos—hundreds of drones and dozens of cruise missiles—with strikes on residential buildings, energy facilities and infrastructure across multiple oblasts, producing civilian casualties, apartment‑block fires and rescue operations (https://x.com/wartranslated/status/1987154407155536059; https://x.com/wartranslated/status/1987073771346313481). The scale reinforces a pattern of using mass‑drone employment to overwhelm air defenses and hit soft civilian/critical infrastructure targets.\n\n2) Ukrainian deep strikes against Russian energy and industrial nodes\nOpen‑source imagery and multiple local reports indicate Ukrainian attack drones struck refineries, petrochemical plants and key substations inside Russia (Kstovo, Sterlitamak, Kostroma region, Volgograd and port facilities at Tuapse). These strikes have caused fires, forced temporary shutdowns and damaged processing units—suggesting Ukraine’s intent to degrade Russia’s industrial base and power generation beyond frontline attrition (https://x.com/Osinttechnical/status/1985708204521898168; https://x.com/wartranslated/status/1986760324817588525; https://x.com/Osinttechnical/status/1986552882988974461; https://x.com/wartranslated/status/1985301608733819007).\n\n3) Targeting of rail/logistics (Ukraine and Russia) and locomotive losses\nOSINT observers have documented strikes on a major Kyiv–Poltava railway junction and multiple locomotive/repair depots and fuel trains; partisans and sabotage groups are also claiming attacks on Russian rolling stock. Destroying locomotives and junctions is consistent with a deliberate interdiction campaign to starve forward formations of materiel and demonstrates a campaign focus on logistics (https://x.com/Schizointel/status/1987166705563390389; https://x.com/Schizointel/status/1987166946140537243; https://x.com/Schizointel/status/1986687814835077336).\n\n4) Ukrainian Special Ops / FPV drone effects and air‑defense innovation\nOSINT footage and unit claims show Ukrainian SSO and UAS units destroying high‑value air defense assets (S‑400 TELs in Crimea) and using FP‑series attack drones against Russian SAM batteries and logistics nodes. Separately, first public footage of the UK‑engineered Raven SAM engaging and downing Kh‑59/Kh‑101 cruise missiles indicates rapid fielding of low‑cost, effective countermeasures (https://x.com/wartranslated/status/1987093732210999530; https://x.com/Osinttechnical/status/1986930861963673939).\n\n5) U.S. force posture in the Caribbean / Venezuela contingency signaling\nOSINT shows increased U.S. amphibious, carrier and long‑range bomber presence in the Atlantic/Caribbean and forward positioning of radar and air assets at regional airfields (Roosevelt Roads/Ceiba, St. Croix, B‑52 sorties). These movements accompany intense U.S. political/diplomatic activity related to Venezuela and reflect contingency planning and signaling (https://x.com/sentdefender/status/1985477303162331249; https://x.com/MT_Anderson/status/1985702765264269368; https://x.com/sentdefender/status/1986504540984955126).\n\n6) High‑profile civilian incidents and domestic crises\n- Louisville MD‑11 (UPS Flight 2976) crash: extensive OSINT video, aerial/satellite imagery and official reporting indicate a catastrophic takeoff failure with large fire and multiple casualties; flight recorders reportedly recovered and investigations underway (https://x.com/sentdefender/status/1986239536138170543; https://x.com/Osinttechnical/status/1985883276389556314).\n- Tehran water emergency: satellite and official warnings highlight precipitously low dam/reservoir levels and local water rationing/evacuation risk, a significant urban humanitarian threat (https://x.com/FaytuksNetwork/status/1987081884912791633).\n\n7) NATO / European airspace incidents and escalation risk\nBelgium closed airspace and suspended airport operations after multiple unidentified drone incursions near major civilian and military airports, prompting allied concern and the deployment of defensive detection systems; OSINT and security reporting point to suspected state‑level actors in some assessments (https://x.com/Osinttechnical/status/1985806210164006935; https://x.com/sentdefender/status/1986616845265478091).\n\nAdditional contextual items worth noting\n- Political/diplomatic moves: U.S.–Hungary discussions and reported short‑term sanctions exemptions around Russian energy were flagged in OSINT reporting of high‑level meetings (https://x.com/wartranslated/status/1987110740684111956). These are relevant to energy flows and geopolitical signaling.\n- Strategic rhetoric and nuclear posture: open reporting captured statements and orders in Moscow to prepare proposals for nuclear testing after U.S. statements about tests—an important escalation risk to monitor (https://x.com/wartranslated/status/1986083159499214856).\n\nAssessment and implications\nOSINT across social, imagery and timestamped reporting points to an escalation in both the intensity and sophistication of operations: Ukrainian forces are striking deeper and focusing on logistics/energy nodes; Russian forces are employing mass drone salvos and cruise missiles to saturate defenses and inflict civilian damage; and third‑party escalatory risks (European airspace drone incidents, U.S.–Venezuela signaling, nuclear rhetoric) raise the possibility of wider political‑military spillovers. Continued monitoring is recommended for (1) strike cadence and hit‑rates on critical energy/rail nodes, (2) air‑defense effectiveness (including Raven and other low‑cost systems), (3) US naval/air deployments in the Caribbean, and (4) non‑combat humanitarian crises (Tehran water, Sudan atrocity sites, and civil aviation accident investigations).\n\nRepresentative OSINT source links (inline examples used above)\n- Russia 450 drones / 45 missiles overnight strike and casualties: https://x.com/wartranslated/status/1987154407155536059\n- Raven SAM footage engaging Kh‑59 and Kh‑101: https://x.com/Osinttechnical/status/1986930861963673939 and https://x.com/wartranslated/status/1987128327916958083\n- Kyiv–Poltava railway junction destroyed (locomotives/depots hit): https://x.com/Schizointel/status/1987166705563390389 and https://x.com/Schizointel/status/1987166946140537243\n- Sterlitamak / Kstovo / Volgograd / Tuapse industrial hits: https://x.com/wartranslated/status/1986760324817588525; https://x.com/Osinttechnical/status/1985708204521898168; https://x.com/Osinttechnical/status/1986552882988974461; https://x.com/wartranslated/status/1985301608733819007\n- Pokrovsk / frontline advances: https://x.com/criticalthreats/status/1986997449240813864\n- USS Gerald R. Ford / Caribbean posture & Roosevelt Roads staging: https://x.com/sentdefender/status/1985477303162331249; https://x.com/MT_Anderson/status/1985702765264269368\n- UPS Flight 2976 crash reporting & footage: https://x.com/sentdefender/status/1986239536138170543; https://x.com/Osinttechnical/status/1985883276389556314\n- Belgium airspace / drone incursions: https://x.com/Osinttechnical/status/1985806210164006935\n- Tehran reservoirs / water crisis (satellite analysis): https://x.com/FaytuksNetwork/status/1987081884912791633\n- RSF mass‑atrocity geolocated reporting (Bellingcat/OSINT): https://x.com/Schizointel/status/1986115671416050100\n\nIf you want, I can (a) extract the raw OSINT images/footage timestamps and geolocations mentioned in these posts, (b) compile a short‑term timeline of attacks by location and method (drones vs missiles vs ground strikes) from these feeds, or (c) prioritize which sites to monitor continuously (rail hubs, selected refineries, and substations)."
