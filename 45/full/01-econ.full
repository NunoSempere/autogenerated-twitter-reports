A medical student who has learned to perform an operation in a medical school class has not learned it in the same way as a doctor who has already conducted several operations. People who excel at book learning tend to call up from memory what they have learned in order to follow stored instructions. People who have internalized their learning use the thoughts flowing from their subconscious without thinking, in the same way they walk down the street. Understanding these differences is essential. #principleoftheday",

Similarly, if an economy turns bad enough, those responsible for running it will make the political and policy changes that are needed—or they will not survive, making room for their replacements to come along. These cycles are continuous and play out in logical ways—and they tend to be self-reinforcing.\n\nThe key is to fail, learn, and improve quickly.

Separately, the Fed looks partisan for not cutting interest rates more than it has done already. A decision to not cut rates in December would be “indefensible.”\n\nhttps://t.co/DP9r4MRKku\n\nHassett: \"The outlook for growth going forward is just fantastic, that we've got a capital spending boom— next time I come on your show, Maria, let me show you some charts. You know I love to do that. But there's a capital spending boom right now that unlike anything we've ever seen, and you know that when people are building factories and buying machines, then that creates jobs. I think that because AI is increasing the productivity of every worker, there are a whole bunch of studies now talking about this that we're looking at underlying productivity growth of around 2%. And so with capital spending growth and productivity growth, you're basically looking at an easy guesstimate of next year's growth of 4%. And so all we have to do is get Congress to settle down and let our policies start to work, and we'll be looking at the golden age that the President talks about.\"\n\nHassett: \"To be sure the labor market is a little bit softer right now, in part, I think, because of the uncertainty over the government shutdown. The bottom line going forward is that the economy will recover and will be doing fine if we could just get the government opened. And as far as the Fed is concerned, I was very disappointed. Again, you and I have talked about the potential risk that the Fed becomes a partisan organization. Think about it. At the [September] meeting, they basically signaled that there would be three rate cuts, and then at [the October] meeting they said, well, probably not in December. And the bottom line is what was the news between the two meetings? The news was that the shutdown created a negative shock to GDP, which should make them more likely to move. And we got inflation numbers that were better than 43 economists at Bloomberg expected, which should make them more likely to move. And they said they're less likely to move, which is really a puzzle. And so I think that you're right that the weaker numbers from the shutdown are going to make it really indefensible if they don't move, but I'm not sure that they haven't become a partisan organization that's going to be played politics.\"",

      "summary": "Direct answer — the key economics events this week\n- The US government shutdown and its economic fallout: expanding operational disruptions (flight cancellations and FAA cuts), cashflow stress for federal workers, legal combat over November SNAP (food‑aid) payments and growing consumer worry that is dragging sentiment and spending. Relevant coverage: Supreme Court/SNAP legal fight (https://x.com/business/status/1986988183179972903), flight cancellations tied to the shutdown (https://x.com/business/status/1986864050513306051), and early signals that consumer sentiment hit a near three‑year low (University of Michigan data) linked to the shutdown (https://x.com/business/status/1986929871864361320).\n\nKey themes and topics discussed in relation to the question\n- Political disruption as economic shock: the protracted US shutdown is showing up in travel (FAA/flight cuts), social safety‑net litigation (SNAP), delayed data releases (jobs report) and weaker consumer confidence. See reporting on shutdown effects and possible legislative fixes (https://x.com/business/status/1986780946662605237 and https://x.com/CNBC/status/1986890745932886427).\n- Market volatility and a tech/AI re‑pricing: big cap tech and AI‑related names (notably Nvidia) saw large market cap drawdowns and higher VIX as investors rotated and de‑risked after a long rally (examples: Nvidia sell‑off and commentary, https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1986829579852321275; volatility pulse, https://x.com/unusual_whales/status/1986895683023221162).\n- Monetary and financial stability debate: the Fed’s semi‑annual financial stability report flagged leverage vulnerabilities even as officials counsel caution on cutting rates; that debate is central to market expectations for a December cut (Fed report commentary, https://x.com/business/status/1986918207039414751; Fed officials’ comments, https://x.com/NickTimiraos/status/1986796880861221040).\n- Labor‑market softening and credit stress: multiple alternative indicators and sector data show weakness — lower job postings, revised employment figures, rising subprime auto and student‑loan delinquency signals, and consumer borrowing trends (job posting decline, https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1986778765649686711; subprime auto delinquencies, https://x.com/unusual_whales/status/1986999869870120984; student‑loan delinquency spikes, https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1986933713456771153).\n- Geopolitics and energy: high‑profile diplomatic moves affecting energy markets — Trump’s meeting with Viktor Orban and an openness to carve out Hungary from Russian energy sanctions, plus US lease auctions and ongoing moves in global oil/Gas trading — are market‑relevant (Orban/ White House coverage, https://x.com/business/status/1986854467862401046; Trump signaling openness to exemptions, https://x.com/business/status/1986865896271352272).\n- AI/data‑center policy and industrial policy: big AI players are asking for tax‑credit/tax‑policy adjustments and other government support for chip and data‑centre investment, which could have large capex and macro effects (OpenAI request for CHIPS Act revamp, https://x.com/business/status/1986906613073002744; corporate debate and spending concerns, https://x.com/business/status/1986892130631958985).\n- Global themes: China’s continuing push in renewables/energy, resumed chip exports from Nexperia (easing supply‑chain risk), sovereign and corporate debt moves in emerging markets and record municipal borrowing in the US were also notable (Nexperia resuming exports, https://x.com/business/status/1986855808819175507; record muni issuance, https://x.com/business/status/1986869531629760580; China clean‑energy/geopolitics, https://x.com/TheEconomist/status/1987007336209117643).\n\nNotable patterns or trends relevant to the question\n- Policy/political risks are currently the dominant macro driver: shutdown, tariff/backlash dynamics and energy‑sanctions diplomacy are moving markets and sentiment more than near‑term macro data.\n- Market breadth is weakening: prolonged rallies are being tested by concentrated losses in AI/tech led positions, with spikes in volatility and rotation into ‘safe haven’ flows (gold ETF inflows, bitcoin & crypto leverage volatility). For examples of market moves and risk flows see Nvidia and ETF/gold coverage (https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1986829579852321275 and https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1986963175770603649).\n- A tentative deceleration in the US labour market is showing up across alternative indicators even while official headline data is delayed — raising uncertainty about the timing of Fed easing.\n- Credit stress and delinquencies are creeping higher in consumer and commercial pockets (subprime auto, commercial mortgage delinquencies and student loans), signaling vulnerability if the downturn deepens (subprime auto delinquencies, https://x.com/unusual_whales/status/1986999869870120984; CMBS delinquencies, https://x.com/unusual_whales/status/1986890649841643999).\n\nImportant mentions, interactions, or data points\n- University of Michigan preliminary Consumer Sentiment: 50.3 (a multi‑year low) — a headline indicator of weakening household confidence (https://x.com/business/status/1986929871864361320).\n- Legal tug‑of‑war over SNAP: lower courts ordered full November payments; administration sought emergency stays; the Supreme Court temporarily blocked disbursement — a major near‑term fiscal/liquidity story for 42 million recipients (legal developments and pause, https://x.com/WSJ/status/1986992549962149952 and https://x.com/unusual_whales/status/1986992684326613075).\n- Markets: S&P and Nasdaq weakness, VIX back above 20, Nvidia’s multi‑day drawdown and large intra‑week market cap swings (https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1986829579852321275; https://x.com/unusual_whales/status/1986895683023221162).\n- Fed and rate expectations: private‑sector and Fed officials indicate caution on a December cut — markets are split and the data blackout from the shutdown complicates the decision (Fed financial stability note and officials, https://x.com/business/status/1986918207039414751; https://x.com/NickTimiraos/status/1986796880861221040).\n- Alternative measures of money and risk: global broad money supply surge and record flows into gold ETFs point to liquidity and risk‑off positioning in parts of the investor community (global money supply, https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1986873575119237407; gold ETF inflows, https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1986963175770603649).\n\nSignificant events or announcements (each with a short paragraph)\n1) US government shutdown: broad economic impact and legal fights over food aid\nThe ongoing, record‑long US government shutdown is the week’s dominant economic story — it has prompted flight cancellations (FAA cuts), delayed official data releases (including the November jobs report), produced sharp falls in consumer sentiment and triggered a legal battle over full November SNAP payments to millions of Americans. The litigation has seen lower courts order payments and the administration seek emergency relief, with the Supreme Court temporarily pausing distribution — a live fiscal‑policy and social‑safety issue that also weighs on retail, travel and holiday spending (legal pause and coverage: https://x.com/WSJ/status/1986992549962149952; shutdown effects and consumer sentiment: https://x.com/business/status/1986929871864361320).\n\n2) Tech/AI re‑rating and market volatility (Nvidia, OpenAI and capital‑spending questions)\nEquity markets experienced sharp intra‑week re‑pricing centered on AI/tech names. Nvidia and related stocks saw big market‑cap swings as investors questioned valuations and geopolitical supply constraints; OpenAI and other AI firms have been publicly pressing for policy changes (tax credits, data‑centre support) while also insisting they don’t want broad government bailouts — creating a political and policy debate about how much to subsidize the AI infrastructure build‑out (Nvidia volatility, https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1986829579852321275; OpenAI request, https://x.com/business/status/1986906613073002744; OpenAI executives under pressure, https://x.com/business/status/1986892130631958985).\n\n3) Consumer/credit stress and labour‑market softening\nMultiple indicators converged this week pointing to a softer US household and labour picture: consumer sentiment tumbled to near‑record lows, job postings and alternative employment data signaled cooling, and pockets of consumer credit stress (subprime auto, student‑loan delinquencies) rose. Together these items raise the risk that an already uncertain seasonal spending period will be weaker and complicate any near‑term Fed easing calculus (consumer sentiment: https://x.com/business/status/1986929871864361320; job postings & delinquencies: https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1986778765649686711; https://x.com/unusual_whales/status/1986999869870120984).\n\n4) Geopolitics meets energy markets: Hungary exemption/Orban visit and global energy moves\nDiplomatic and policy moves around energy were important this week. President Trump hosted Viktor Orban and signaled openness to exempting Hungary from Russian energy sanctions — a step with immediate political and market implications that could reshape sanction enforcement precedents. Separately, the US is moving forward with Gulf of Mexico lease auctions and major energy firms (Petrobras, Santos) report production plans that influence supply expectations (Orban/White House and exemption signals: https://x.com/business/status/1986854467862401046; exemption reporting: https://x.com/business/status/1986903588606444012).\n\nBottom line\nThis week’s economic news was dominated less by single macro statistics than by policy and political shocks: the US shutdown and its spillovers, a volatile reappraisal of AI/tech risks and policy requests by AI firms, increasingly visible consumer and credit stress, and geopolitically charged energy moves. Each of those strands feeds into the key market questions now: will the shutdown deepen the slowdown and delay Fed easing? will AI capex continue to justify elevated valuations or force a longer repricing? and will geopolitical shifts in energy and trade increase policy uncertainty for markets and supply chains?
