Notable patterns & trends
- Political polarization and brinkmanship are spilling into trade and domestic operations: trade negotiation breakdowns (Canada), the extended shutdown, and legal actions against political figures intensified uncertainty.  
- Security-first posture on drugs: the U.S. shifted from law enforcement toward military kinetic action in the hemisphere (carrier deployment and strikes), signaling a more forceful strategy.  
- Markets remain sensitive to inflation signals: cooler CPI data quickly translated into stronger rate‑cut bets and record equity closes, even as underlying consumer pressures (food, rents in some areas) persist.  
- Cultural/security shocks dominated public attention: a museum heist, demolition of a historic White House section, and the NFL/MLB/NBA-related criminal cases kept headlines broad and intense.
