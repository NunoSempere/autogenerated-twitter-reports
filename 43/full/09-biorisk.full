To prepare trainees for practice, teachers need to reframe uncertainty as a central feature of how clinical problems are understood and managed. \n\nClinicians may go to great lengths to reduce uncertainty, often perceiving it as a threat or source of stress. Multiple cultural forces in medicine reinforce this tendency. Physicians receive extensive training in the biomedical sciences, which are grounded in fixed characterizations and clear classifications. Early medical training comprises case-based discussions and standardized tests that use logical causal pathways to arrive at singular correct answers. Clinical training and practice perpetuate this orientation, with peers, teachers, and patients often reacting negatively to uncertainty or equating it with incompetence. Structural elements in the workplace, such as the electronic medical record and billing platforms, require unambiguous characterizations of illnesses or treatments, even when clinical problems remain ill-defined. \n\nAn aversion to uncertainty can induce subconscious efforts to hide, suppress, or minimize it during daily clinical work. Yet uncertainty cannot be eradicated from clinical practice, even as its frontier shifts with advances in technology and treatments. This unyielding reality requires teachers to frame uncertainty not as an undesirable by-product of clinical reasoning but rather as a central feature of it. \n\nA new review focuses on the ways in which clinicians recognize and manage in-the-moment experiences of uncertainty in practice and provides practical strategies that teachers can use to help trainees build confidence in managing uncertainty. \n\nRead the Review Article “Educational Strategies to Prepare Trainees for Clinical Uncertainty,” the latest in the Medical Education series, by Jonathan S.

The images confirmed the previous radiographic findings of innumerable nodules (measuring 1 to 3 mm in diameter) in an even distribution throughout both lungs. An additional enlarged upper paratracheal lymph node with central low attenuation and a thickened rim was present. No mass, consolidation, cavity, or effusion was noted. \n\nOne day later, CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed with the administration of oral and intravenous contrast material in the portal venous phase (Panels B and C). Multiple retroperitoneal and upper abdominal lymph nodes had an appearance that was similar in character to the upper paratracheal lymph node. There were two low-attenuation lesions (measuring up to 4.1 cm in greatest dimension) in the liver that had thickened rims and some internal septation. There was an additional lesion (measuring 2.0 cm in greatest dimension) in the pancreatic head that had no features of pancreatic or biliary duct obstruction. \n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was performed after the administration of gadolinium-based contrast material (Panel D). A single subtle 3-mm focus of enhancement in the right inferior temporal subcortical white matter with minimal surrounding hyperintensity was present on T2-weighted imaging and on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging. No restricted diffusion or susceptibility was present. \n\nRead the full case details in “A 43-Year-Old Woman with Depression, Suicidal Ideation, and Fever,” a Case Record of the Massachusetts General Hospital, by M.S.

      "summarization_question": "Summarize biorisk news last week",
      "summary": "Direct answer — what happened last week:  The week’s biorisk headlines were dominated by a multi‑continent resurgence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5Nx) with many wild bird and poultry detections and sporadic human cases; continuing vaccine‑preventable disease outbreaks (measles, diphtheria) and intensified calls for vaccination; ongoing vector‑borne disease activity (Rift Valley fever, dengue); and two major public‑health developments — the last Ebola patient in the DRC was discharged (starting the countdown to end that outbreak) and WHO published a new National Health Emergency Alert and Response Framework. These events drove heightened surveillance, One Health preparedness actions, and renewed policy/communication efforts. Key themes, trends and notable data points 1) Avian influenza (H5N1/ H5Nx): widespread detections and mammal spillover. H5 detections rose across wild birds and commercial/backyard flocks in North America, Europe and Asia, prompting higher alert levels (e.g., France raised its bird‑flu alert to “high” and required confinement of poultry) and farm depopulation/controls, testing of dairy supply in some US states, and closures/monitoring at zoos and petting farms [see France alert and guidance](https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1980607452547612971) and [Calgary petting‑farm closure](https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1980244803616190679). Multiple USDA/WOAH reports noted dozens of H5 detections in wild birds and outbreaks in commercial poultry across US states and Canadian provinces (examples: large wild‑bird clusters reported in Michigan and Minnesota) [wild bird clusters in Michigan](https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1981353239103599057). Concerning signals included reports of H5 in mammalian predators and other mammals (vultures, bears, a reported swan/bear cluster), and preprint/field reports raising the possibility of detection in bovine semen — all of which increase One Health concerns about cross‑species transmission and biosecurity of animal production systems [bovine semen detection report](https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1979627152967647626). There were also human cases: Cambodia published a cluster of human H5N1 infections (clinical summary in NEJM) [NEJM summary of Cambodian cases](https://x.com/NEJM/status/1981722588490711313) and Mexico reported a human H5 case in Mexico City [Mexico human H5 report](https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1979664738327154982). 2) Vaccine‑preventable disease outbreaks and low uptake. Measles activity continued to expand in multiple jurisdictions (U.S. outbreaks centered on border/twin‑town areas and state clusters), contributing to the highest U.S. case counts in decades (CIDRAP noted US cases topping ~1,600 year‑to‑date) [US measles >1,600](https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1981091631920013775) and highlighting gaps in adult and immigrant vaccine coverage (studies noted low tetanus/diphtheria uptake). Algeria reported a small but fatal diphtheria cluster (5 cases, 2 deaths reported) drawing attention to re‑emergence where vaccination coverage is incomplete [Algeria diphtheria report](https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1980305310767333873). Public health voices and clinicians amplified vaccination messages on social media (examples from infectious‑disease physicians). 3) Other zoonotic and enteric threats: Rift Valley fever and cholera. Rift Valley fever continued to expand in parts of West Africa (Senegal, Mauritania), with hundreds of cases and dozens of deaths in some reports (CIDRAP/FluTrackers summaries) [Rift Valley fever in Senegal](https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1980245547589267846). Cholera remained a major burden in DR Congo with large cumulative case counts and substantial mortality reported (CIDRAP flagged >58,000 cases and ~1,700 deaths over nine months) [DRC cholera situation](https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1981787008675480065). Dengue burdens rose sharply in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and parts of the Americas. 4) End of Ebola outbreak milestone. The last known Ebola patient in the DRC was discharged, initiating the 42‑day countdown to declare that outbreak over — a key operational milestone after vaccination and response efforts reached tens of thousands (WHO and field reporting) [WHO: last Ebola patient discharged](https://x.com/WHO/status/1979895589577068840) and media/field summaries (cases, deaths, vaccine reach) documented the response and outcomes. 5) Preparedness, surveillance and governance actions. WHO published a new National Health Emergency Alert and Response Framework to strengthen country preparedness and response systems based on COVID lessons [WHO framework announcement](https://x.com/WHO/status/1981351992006946985). WHO BioHub and material‑sharing mechanisms were highlighted as supporting rapid sharing of isolates for research (MERS‑CoV example) [WHO BioHub support](https://x.com/mvankerkhove/status/1981342566701551859). Africa CDC and partners emphasized lab capacity mapping, NPHI strengthening, and immunization forums (World Polio Day messaging and polio vaccination pushes) [WHO polio vaccinators story](https://x.com/WHO/status/1982009239338983906) and [Africa CDC World Polio Day statement](https://x.com/AfricaCDC/status/1981707287400939542). 6) Surveillance and research signals. Several studies and trial results were shared that relate to long‑term biological risks and public‑health capacity — e.g., reports on long‑COVID sequelae, RSV vaccine effectiveness in older adults, failures of a CMV vaccine Phase 3 trial (Moderna), and experimental avian‑influenza vaccine research for zoo species (RNA replicon protection) — underscoring the mixed progress in biomedical countermeasures and the ongoing need for surveillance and R&D [Moderna CMV trial failure](https://x.com/statnews/status/1981364767441736056) and [RNA replicon protection in zoo birds](https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1980448885496823925). Notable patterns and trends observed 1) Seasonal and geographic amplification: respiratory and vectorborne seasonal diseases (influenza, pediatric severe flu cases, dengue, chikungunya) rose earlier or higher than typical in multiple regions (Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, parts of Africa and the Americas), increasing pressure on surveillance systems and hospital capacity. Examples: early influenza activity in Japan and Hong Kong pediatric severe influenza reports [Japan flu concern](https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1980728436013383728). 2) One Health convergence: increasing H5 detections in wild birds, domestic flocks, and mammals — plus possible detection in cattle semen and dairy testing measures — highlighted cross‑sector risks to animal health, public health and food systems and pushed authorities toward stronger biosecurity and interagency coordination (e.g., farm quarantines, milk testing in Wisconsin) [Wisconsin milk testing story](https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1981793097014292724). 3) Persistent gaps in vaccination and the consequences: measles and diphtheria clusters continue where coverage is incomplete; public‑facing clinicians and organizations stepped up vaccine advocacy and public messaging (examples from @DrNeilStone and NEJM editorials) [measles outbreak report](https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1981797196451201037) and [NEJM editorial on vaccines](https://x.com/NEJM/status/1980680651474125162). 4) Continued emphasis on surveillance data sharing and preparedness policy after COVID: WHO and regional bodies advanced frameworks, lab mapping and BioHub use to shorten detection‑to‑response times. Important specific mentions / data points (representative): - US measles total reported >1,600 YTD (CIDRAP) [US measles >1,600](https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1981091631920013775). - Cambodia described 16 human H5N1 cases Feb 2023–Aug 2024 in a NEJM report [Cambodia H5N1 cases (NEJM)](https://x.com/NEJM/status/1981722588490711313). - Mexico confirmed a human H5 case reported in late Sep/Oct [Mexico H5 human case](https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1979664738327154982). - DRC cholera: >58,000 cases and ~1,700 deaths over 9 months (MSF/CIDRAP reporting) [DRC cholera](https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1981787008675480065). - Algeria diphtheria cluster: 5 cases, 2 deaths (local report) [Algeria diphtheria](https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1980305310767333873). - Senegal Rift Valley fever: hundreds of cases and multiple deaths reported in the recent wave [RVF in Senegal](https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1980245547589267846). Significant events / developments (short paragraphs each) 1) H5N1 resurgence and One‑Health alarms — biggest weeklong story: HPAI H5Nx activity accelerated across wild birds, poultry farms and multiple countries in North America, Europe and Asia, with spillover into mammal species and troubling sentinel reports (e.g., possible detection in bovine semen). Authorities raised alert levels in some countries (France), mandated poultry confinement, expanded farm biosecurity and began targeted testing of dairy/milk in affected areas. Human H5 cases were reported (Cambodia/NEJM summary and a Mexico case), though human infections remained sporadic; nevertheless the breadth of animal infections and mammalian spillovers sustained elevated One Health concern and action [France alert](https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1980607452547612971), [Cambodia cases](https://x.com/NEJM/status/1981722588490711313), [Mexico human case](https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1979664738327154982), [bovine semen detection](https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1979627152967647626). 2) End of DRC Ebola outbreak response milestone: WHO confirmed that the last known Ebola patient in the DRC was discharged and the 42‑day countdown to declare the outbreak over has begun. The response included ring vaccination campaigns (tens of thousands vaccinated) and community measures; this discharge was widely reported as a key operational success and a relief for constrained response teams [WHO: last Ebola patient discharged](https://x.com/WHO/status/1979895589577068840). 3) Measles resurgence and vaccine gaps: measles clusters expanded in the U.S. (including a multi‑jurisdiction outbreak on the AZ‑UT border and local state outbreaks such as South Carolina) and outbreaks in other countries persisted; public health groups urged catch‑up vaccination and stronger vaccine uptake among under‑immunized populations, noting that low adult/immigrant uptake and pockets of hesitancy are driving preventable morbidity [Arizona‑Utah measles cluster](https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1981797196451201037) and [US measles >1,600](https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1981091631920013775). 4) WHO policy and preparedness steps: WHO released a National Health Emergency Alert and Response Framework to strengthen country preparedness, and WHO BioHub/ material sharing received attention as mechanisms to accelerate access to isolates for research; regional bodies (Africa CDC) advanced lab‑capacity mapping and NPHI strengthening while marking World Polio Day with renewed vaccination appeals [WHO framework](https://x.com/WHO/status/1981351992006946985) and [WHO polio vaccinators story](https://x.com/WHO/status/1982009239338983906). Bottom line / implications: Last week reinforced that zoonotic influenza remains the dominant acute biorisk — with broad geographic spread, mammalian spillover signals and impacts to animal production and surveillance systems — while vaccine‑preventable outbreaks (measles, diphtheria) and endemic/epidemic threats (cholera, Rift Valley fever, dengue) continue to expose gaps in immunization, surveillance and health system resilience. The WHO and regional bodies moved to strengthen readiness and lab/surveillance capacity, and the DRC Ebola discharge was a notable operational success. Continued priorities: maintain aggressive One Health surveillance for H5/H9 and other zoonoses; accelerate routine vaccination and outbreak response in under‑immunized populations; sustain laboratory and emergency response capacity; and monitor potential food‑chain/production risks arising from animal infections (dairy, breeding stock)."
