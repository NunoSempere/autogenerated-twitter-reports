At the appropriate time, we'll lay out what the plan is. But there's a plan.‚Äù\n\nBannon helped orchestrate Trump's first rise to the presidency in 2016 and also served time in prison for defying a subpoena in the congressional investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. In 2021, Trump pardoned Bannon in a separate case, after Bannon was charged for misleading thousands of donors into thinking their contributions were going toward a wall along the southern border. \n\nBannon, who hosts the ‚ÄúWar Room‚Äù podcast, called Trump ‚Äúan instrument of divine will‚Äù in the interview.\n\n‚ÄúThe only way President Trump wins in 2028 and continues to stay in office is by the will of the American people,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe will of the American people is what the Constitution embodies. So I think we're going to be in good hands there. We need to finish what we started.‚Äù",

[Reuters: government shutdown milestones and economic risk](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1981914157164200377).  \n- Trade and geopolitics: President Trump abruptly ended trade talks with Canada over an Ontario ad (and Canada moved to pull the ad), and U.S.-China trade/tech tensions continued as Trump prepares talks with Xi. [Reuters: Trump ends trade talks with Canada](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1981748769113964586).  \n- Military escalation in the Caribbean: the U.S. deployed the Gerald R. Ford carrier strike group and carried out lethal strikes on alleged drug‚Äësmuggling vessels, with reported fatalities and rising political controversy. [Reuters: carrier deployment and strikes](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1981786138089050464) and [Reuters: strike that killed six](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1981844428823118247).  \n- Economy and markets: September CPI showed cooler-than-expected inflation (about 3%), boosting market hopes of Fed cuts and lifting U.S. stock indexes to record highs. [Reuters: CPI and market reaction](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1981701452688249013) and [Reuters: Wall Street record highs](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1981904797092733146).  \n- Legal, criminal and institutional shocks: high-profile indictments/arrests in an illegal gambling probe involving NBA figures; New York AG Letitia James pleaded not guilty in federal court; and the Louvre jewel heist and related investigation drew international attention. [NBCNews: indictments in gambling probe](https://x.com/NBCNews/status/1981672048431628516), [Reuters: Letitia James pleads not guilty](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1981751954377179571), [ABC: Louvre heist details](https://x.com/ABC/status/1981847177312739652).  \n- White House renovations controversy: demolition of the East Wing to build a new presidential ballroom drew preservationist and public backlash. [Reuters: East Wing demolition coverage](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1981797849114587338).  \n- Weather and safety risks: Tropical Storm Melissa threatened the Caribbean with heavy rains and possible major‚Äëhurricane strengthening. [CBSNews: Melissa outlook and risks](https://x.com/CBSNews/status/1981748768673337768).\n\nNotable patterns & trends\n- Political polarization and brinkmanship are spilling into trade and domestic operations: trade negotiation breakdowns (Canada), the extended shutdown, and legal actions against political figures intensified uncertainty.  \n- Security-first posture on drugs: the U.S. shifted from law enforcement toward military kinetic action in the hemisphere (carrier deployment and strikes), signaling a more forceful strategy.  \n- Markets remain sensitive to inflation signals: cooler CPI data quickly translated into stronger rate‚Äëcut bets and record equity closes, even as underlying consumer pressures (food, rents in some areas) persist.  \n- Cultural/security shocks dominated public attention: a museum heist, demolition of a historic White House section, and the NFL/MLB/NBA-related criminal cases kept headlines broad and intense.\n\nImportant mentions, interactions, and data points\n- Shutdown scope: more than 3 million federal workers affected, with many missing pay; states warned SNAP benefits could be suspended for some recipients at month‚Äôs end. [ABC: federal workers missing paychecks and assistance](https://x.com/ABC/status/1981850696317055448).  \n- Inflation and Fed expectations: September CPI ~3% year/year and modest monthly prints kept the Fed on a path seen by markets as consistent with upcoming rate cuts. [Reuters: CPI report](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1981701452688249013).  \n- Social Security cost‚Äëof‚Äëliving increase: SSA announced a 2.8% COLA for beneficiaries starting in January (affects roughly 75 million recipients). [ABC / News on COLA](https://x.com/ABC/status/1981881163632283935).  \n- Sport and culture: Toronto Blue Jays opened the World Series with a notable win and provided a public rallying point amid political tension with the U.S. (coverage connected to the Trump-Canada trade row). [Reuters: Blue Jays stun Ohtani, Dodgers in World Series opener](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1981963976154984522) and [Reuters: Canadians rally around Blue Jays after Trump outburst](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1981898534409416847).\n\nSignificant events (one paragraph each)\n- Government shutdown and its fallout: The impasse moved into its third/fourth week, with more than half a million federal employees missing a full paycheck and many more furloughed; services and data releases were delayed (raising concerns about SNAP benefits, censuses, and economic transparency), and the human impact‚Äîlines at food banks and financial strain‚Äîdominated domestic coverage. [Reuters: shutdown milestones and economic pain](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1981914157164200377) and [ABC: assistance for furloughed workers](https://x.com/ABC/status/1981850696317055448).  \n\n- Trump halts trade talks with Canada over ad controversy: President Trump abruptly terminated U.S.-Canada trade negotiations after an Ontario TV ad used selective audio of Ronald Reagan; Ontario agreed to take down the ad and Canadian leaders signaled willingness to resume talks when ready, but the episode heightened bilateral tensions just before major diplomatic meetings. [Reuters: Trump ends trade talks](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1981748769113964586) and [NewsHour: Ontario to pull the ad](https://x.com/NewsHour/status/1981816960246542689).  \n\n- U.S. military escalation in the Caribbean and strikes on drug vessels: The Pentagon deployed the USS Gerald R. Ford carrier strike group to the region and reported lethal strikes on an alleged drug‚Äërunning vessel that killed six‚Äîmoves framed by the administration as a tougher stance against cartels but that drew scrutiny over scope, legality, and regional reaction.
