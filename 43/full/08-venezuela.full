Before Arctic ice sets in, I grabbed high-res imagery (Oct 21) of three key Northern Fleet sub bases. Olenya Guba's main piers are empty, but the larger picture from Nerpa reveals the fleet's current state—and a massive new clue (for those of us nerds who follow the northern fleet🤣).\n\n🚨 K-560 (Severodvinsk) Found: After being missing from OSINT tracking, the Yasen-Class SSGN Severodvinsk (K-560) is visible at Nerpa. Commissioned in 2014, she is likely overdue for reactor refueling and major overhaul. Finding her in dry dock solves a major mystery and takes a top-tier asset off the operational board for now.\n\nAlso present: The specialized, highly modified Delta-Class sub BS-136 Orenburg. \n\nAs always when it comes to the Russian fleet, hat tip to @The_Lookout_N  for the great foundational analysis! \n\nIf you don't follow him, and you are interested in the Northern Fleet, and a NATO view from the northernmost part of Europe, you should give him a follow.\n\nMoving on, the picture deepens:\n\nVidayevo: Shows multiple large attack submarines, likely a mix of Victor III and Sierra II classes.\n\nPolyarny: Shows 4x Kilo-Class subs and 1x Lada-Class alongside\n\nI'll admit—I struggle with the Kilo vs. Lada and Victor III vs. Sierra II external IDs! \n\nThese Soviet-era distinctions are tough. Can any of my Russian/Naval followers confirm the exact ID of the Sierra II/Victor III and Lada/Kilo boats at Vidayevo and Polyarny (and help me with characteristics for future IDs)? \n\nThe strategic reality: Having another Yasen Class in dry dock (in addition to the Yasen-M in the Pacific Fleet) should give some 'warm fuzzies' to us in the west.\n\nSource: Maxar powered by @SkyfiApp \nDate: 21 October 2025\n\n@Schizointel @GrangerE04117",

I told him I think he is making a mistake, because we can do it much faster, and remove the criminals that the Law does not permit him to remove. I told him, “It’s an easier process if we do it, faster, stronger, and safer but, let’s see how you do?” The people of San Francisco have come together on fighting Crime, especially since we began to take charge of that very nasty subject. Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great.

      "summary": "Direct answer\nThis week saw a sharp escalation of U.S. military pressure in and around Venezuela — including the redirection of significant naval and air assets to the U.S. Southern Command area, repeated long-range bomber “attack demonstrations” near the Venezuelan coast, strikes on alleged narco-trafficking vessels, and reports that high-altitude ISR business-jet prototypes have been tasked to the region — alongside heightened rhetoric from the Trump Administration about possible \"land action\" and firm denials/contradictions about specific flights. The Venezuelan government pushed back (military and political leaders framed this as an existential threat), while local developments (naval ship movements and a Reuters human-interest report on flood victims) continued domestically. Key source examples: carrier redeployment (https://x.com/SA_Defensa/status/1981765215349014647; https://x.com/sentdefender/status/1981762935820112305), bomber flights (https://x.com/ianellisjones/status/1981519048266653838; https://x.com/SA_Defensa/status/1981451703732834743), and strikes on suspected narco vessels (https://x.com/sentdefender/status/1981713849670664575).\n\nKey themes and topics\n- U.S. military escalation and forward posture: The USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group was ordered to the SOUTHCOM AOR to augment existing forces (joining an amphibious ready group), and U.S. naval and air assets already operating in the Caribbean were publicly described as being focused on counter–narcotics and ”narco‑terrorism” missions [https://x.com/SA_Defensa/status/1981765215349014647; https://x.com/sentdefender/status/1981762935820112305].\n- Bomber sorties and ‘‘attack demonstrations’’: Long‑range bomber flights (B-1Bs, and earlier B-52s) conducted close approaches to Venezuelan waters as demonstrations or rehearsals; one such mission was widely reported and tracked on flight monitoring services [https://x.com/ianellisjones/status/1981519048266653838; https://x.com/SA_Defensa/status/1981417398663024768]. Reuters also covered administration comments denying some reports about bomber deployments (see below) [https://x.com/Reuters/status/1981587737036656648].\n- Direct strikes against maritime narcotics targets: The U.S. reported strikes against alleged narco‑trafficking vessels in the Southern Caribbean, with U.S. accounts saying the targets were linked to Venezuelan transnational criminal groups (e.g., Tren de Aragua) [https://x.com/sentdefender/status/1981713849670664575].\n- ISR and specialized aircraft redeployments: Experimental, high‑altitude, business‑jet ISR platforms (ARTEMIS/ARES/ATHENA variants) were reported tasked to SOUTHCOM to enhance regional surveillance and targeting [https://x.com/sentdefender/status/1981919861015253442; https://x.com/SA_Defensa/status/1981762277633405359].\n- Domestic and international political/legal debate: Reports note some U.S. lawmakers from both parties questioning the legal basis for strikes and a series of classified briefings for Congress; domestic political rhetoric included both calls for stronger action and denials/minimizations by the White House about certain flights [https://x.com/sentdefender/status/1981784816593834087; https://x.com/Reuters/status/1981587737036656648].\n- Venezuelan posture and regional reaction: Venezuelan leaders (including Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino López) publicly denounced U.S. actions as an extreme threat and vowed resistance; regional political voices and Allied actors reacted variably, with some Latin American figures supporting U.S. pressure and others warning about escalation [https://x.com/SA_Defensa/status/1981858864124567601; https://x.com/RepCarlos/status/1981413160386253268].\n- Local maritime/naval developments and human‑interest reporting: Venezuelan navy and shipyard observations (e.g., Almirante Brión out of water; recovery/grounding of ARV Capana) were noted by regional open‑source trackers, and Reuters published a story on a Valencia flood victim found a year later, showing continuing domestic crises alongside security tensions [https://x.com/SA_Defensa/status/1981895989746409519; https://x.com/SA_Defensa/status/1981878372830757056; https://x.com/ReutersWorld/status/1981928745985290300].\n\nNotable patterns and trends\n- Concentration of force and repositioning from other theaters: Multiple reports indicate U.S. assets being recalled or redirected from Europe/Indo-Pacific to the Caribbean/SOUTHCOM AOR (carrier, ISR platforms, forward-deployed aircraft), showing a short‑term prioritization of the Western Hemisphere [https://x.com/sentdefender/status/1981768293049323670; https://x.com/sentdefender/status/1981762935820112305].\n- Repeated use of show‑of‑force flights and limited kinetic strikes: The pattern of bomber ‘‘demonstrations’’ near Venezuelan waters plus targeted strikes against maritime narcotics vessels suggests a calibrated approach — pressure and deterrence backed by limited kinetic action rather than (so far) broad conventional ground operations [https://x.com/ianellisjones/status/1981519048266653838; https://x.com/sentdefender/status/1981713849670664575].\n- Escalatory rhetoric and uncertainty: Public statements from the White House about possible \"land action\" and simultaneous denials about specific reported flights, plus Congressional scrutiny, create a dissonant signal — rising risk perception coupled with unclear policy timelines and legal bases [https://x.com/sentdefender/status/1981479743456497827; https://x.com/sentdefender/status/1981458476191887831].\n- Information amplification by open‑source trackers and social outlets: Independent aviation/military trackers and regional social accounts played a large role in identifying flights, ship movements and ISR tasking — contributing to rapid public awareness and market reactions (e.g., betting markets) [https://x.com/ianellisjones/status/1981870670234661153; https://x.com/sentdefender/status/1981822511416549840].\n\nImportant mentions, interactions, and data points\n- Carrier redeployment: USS Gerald R. Ford CSG ordered to SOUTHCOM; will join the Iwo Jima ARG (reported by regional trackers and defense accounts) [https://x.com/SA_Defensa/status/1981765215349014647; https://x.com/sentdefender/status/1981762935820112305].\n- Bomber missions: At least two B-1B bomber missions tracked within ~50–100 miles of the Venezuelan coast; Pentagon described flights as ‘‘attack demonstrations’’; President Trump gave inconsistent public comments about the flights [https://x.com/ianellisjones/status/1981519048266653838; https://x.com/SA_Defensa/status/1981451703732834743; https://x.com/Reuters/status/1981587737036656648].\n- Maritime strikes: U.S. statements and released footage claim strikes on narco‑trafficking vessels tied to Venezuelan criminal groups, with casualties reported in U.S. accounts; Secretary of Defense footage/releases were cited in social reports [https://x.com/sentdefender/status/1981713849670664575; https://x.com/DOWResponse/status/1981424850942972076].\n- ISR tasking: ARTEMIS/ARES/ATHENA business‑jet ISR prototypes reported redirected to SOUTHCOM to collect ISR against Venezuela and cartel operations [https://x.com/sentdefender/status/1981919861015253442; https://x.com/SA_Defensa/status/1981762277633405359].\n- Domestic and political responses: Venezuelan Defense Minister framed the situation as the gravest threat in a century and vowed non‑submission; some Colombian voices publicly welcomed stronger action against Maduro-linked actors [https://x.com/SA_Defensa/status/1981858864124567601; https://x.com/RepCarlos/status/1981413160386253268].\n- Legal/political scrutiny: Reports of bipartisan questioning in Congress about the legal justification for strikes and classified briefings being held for lawmakers were noted in open reporting [https://x.com/sentdefender/status/1981784816593834087].\n- Local maritime/naval updates and human stories: Observers noted the Almirante Brión frigate out of water and the ARV Capana recovered after grounding; Reuters reported a Valencia flood victim found a year later — reminders that domestic humanitarian and naval‑maintenance issues persist amid geopolitical tensions [https://x.com/SA_Defensa/status/1981895989746409519; https://x.com/SA_Defensa/status/1981878372830757056; https://x.com/ReutersWorld/status/1981928745985290300].\n\nSignificant events (one paragraph each)\n1) Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group redirected to SOUTHCOM: Multiple defense trackers and open sources reported the U.S. ordered the USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group back toward the Caribbean/SOUTHCOM area to augment forces countering narcotics trafficking and to interact with already‑deployed amphibious forces. This represents a major shift in deployed sea power to the region and was widely cited as the most consequential conventional force move this week [https://x.com/SA_Defensa/status/1981765215349014647; https://x.com/sentdefender/status/1981762935820112305].\n\n2) Repeated bomber ‘‘attack demonstrations’’ and close flights: The U.S. conducted at least two publicized long‑range bomber missions (B-1Bs; earlier B-52s reported previously) that flew within roughly 50–100 miles of Venezuela — actions the Pentagon called demonstrations — while the President publicly denied parts of those reports and simultaneously spoke of forthcoming \"land action,\" intensifying uncertainty and public alarm in the region [https://x.com/ianellisjones/status/1981519048266653838; https://x.com/SA_Defensa/status/1981451703732834743; https://x.com/Reuters/status/1981587737036656648; https://x.com/sentdefender/status/1981479743456497827].\n\n3) Kinetic strikes on alleged narco‑trafficking vessels and expanded ISR tasking: U.S. forces released accounts/footage of strikes against maritime narcotics targets in the Southern Caribbean reportedly tied to Venezuelan transnational criminal organizations; at the same time, experimental ISR business-jet variants (ARTEMIS/ARES/ATHENA) were reported tasked to SOUTHCOM to support monitoring and targeting — signaling an integrated air/sea intelligence and strike campaign focused on interdiction and pressure against the Maduro‑linked networks [https://x.com/sentdefender/status/1981713849670664575; https://x.com/sentdefender/status/1981919861015253442; https://x.com/SA_Defensa/status/1981762277633405359].\n\nRisk and trajectory\nThe week’s pattern is one of deliberate U.S. pressure via naval and air power, targeted maritime strikes, and intensified ISR — calibrated to disrupt trafficking networks while signaling to the Maduro government. However, the combination of aggressive demonstrations, public calls about imminent \"land action,\" partisan/legal scrutiny in the U.S., and force repositioning increases the risk of miscalculation or accidental escalation. Watch for: further carrier/air assets arriving or departing, additional maritime strike announcements, clearer legal/policy statements from U.S. leadership or Congress, and Venezuelan defensive or retaliatory moves (military posturing, interdictions, or actions against perceived collaborators).\n\nSources (examples cited inline in text)\n- Carrier redeployment and naval movements: https://x.com/SA_Defensa/status/1981765215349014647; https://x.com/sentdefender/status/1981762935820112305\n- Bomber flights/attack demonstrations: https://x.com/ianellisjones/status/1981519048266653838; https://x.com/SA_Defensa/status/1981451703732834743; https://x.com/Reuters/status/1981587737036656648\n- Maritime strikes and ISR tasking: https://x.com/sentdefender/status/1981713849670664575; https://x.com/sentdefender/status/1981919861015253442\n- Venezuelan official reactions: https://x.com/SA_Defensa/status/1981858864124567601\n- Local naval observations and a domestic human‑interest report: https://x.com/SA_Defensa/status/1981895989746409519; https://x.com/SA_Defensa/status/1981878372830757056; https://x.com/ReutersWorld/status/1981928745985290300"
