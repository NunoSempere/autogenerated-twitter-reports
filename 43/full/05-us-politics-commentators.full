I want to use this moment to speak to the Muslims of this city.\n\nI want to speak to the memory of my aunt, who stopped taking the subway after September 11th because she did not feel safe in her hijab.¬†\n\nI want to speak to the Muslim who works for our city‚Äîwhether they teach in our schools or walk the beat for the NYPD, New Yorkers who all make daily sacrifices on behalf of this city, only to see their leaders spit in their face.\n\nI want to speak to every child who grows up in New York marked as the Other, who is randomly selected in a way that rarely feels random, who feels that they carry a stain that can never be cleaned.\n\nGrowing up in the shadow of 9/11, I have known what it means to live with an undercurrent of suspicion. I will always remember the disdain I faced, the way my name could immediately become ‚ÄúMohammad,‚Äù and how I could return to my city only to be asked in a double mirrored room at the airport if I had any plan of attacking it.\n\nAnd since I was very young, I have known that I was spared the worst of it. I was never pressured to be an informant like classmates of mine. I have never had the word ‚Äòterrorist‚Äô spray-painted on my garage, as one of my aides has. My mosque has never been set on fire.\n\nTo be Muslim in New York is to expect indignity. But indignity does not make us distinct‚Äîthere are many who face it. It is the tolerance of that indignity that does.",

Trump is calling Reagan‚Äôs words in this video ‚ÄúFAKE‚Äù and ‚Äúfraudulent.‚Äù They‚Äôre 100% real. And the original clip is actually far worse for Trump, as much is left out of the ad. Watch this clip and read the full transcript:\n\nThroughout the world, there's a growing realization that the way to prosperity for all nations is rejecting protectionist legislation and promoting fair and free competition. Now, there are sound historical reasons for this. For those of us who lived through the Great Depression, the memory of the suffering it caused is deep and searing. And today, many economic analysts and historians argue that high tariff legislation passed back in that period, called the Smoot-Hawley tariff, greatly deepened the depression and prevented economic recovery.\n\nYou see, at first when someone says, let's impose tariffs on foreign imports, it looks like they're doing the patriotic thing by protecting American products and jobs. And sometimes for a short while, it works, but only for a short time. What eventually occurs is, first, homegrown industries start relying on government protection in the form of high tariffs. They stop competing and stop making the innovative management and technological changes they need to succeed in world markets.\n\nAnd then, while all this is going on, something even worse occurs. High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars. The result is more and more tariffs, higher and higher trade barriers, and less and less competition. So soon, because of the prices made artificially high by tariffs that subsidize inefficiency and poor management, people stop buying.\n\nThen the worst happens. Markets shrink and collapse, businesses and industry shut down, and millions of people lose their jobs. The memory of all this occurring back in the 30s made me determined when I came to Washington to spare the American people the protectionist legislation that destroys prosperity. Now, it hasn't always been easy. There are those in the Congress, just as there were back in the 30s, who want to go for the quick political advantage, who risk America's prosperity for the sake of a short-term appeal to some special interest group, who forget that more than 5 million American jobs are directly tied to the foreign export business, and additional millions are tied to imports.\n\nWell, I've never forgotten those jobs. And on trade issues, by and large, we've done well.",

      "summary": "Direct answer\nThis week‚Äôs most important stories: (1) the White House East Wing was demolished as part of a controversial plan to build a large private-style ballroom; (2) a continuing federal government shutdown produced immediate pain for federal workers and millions who rely on SNAP while an anonymous donor reportedly covered $130M in military pay; (3) sharp diplomatic and trade flare-ups ‚Äî most visibly a public dispute with Canada after an ad using Ronald Reagan quotes ‚Äî and fast-moving trade/tariff impacts; (4) sweeping executive actions and pardons that are fueling political and legal fights (including the pardon of Binance founder Changpeng Zhao and many pardons for Jan. 6 defendants); (5) new, aggressive military and law-enforcement moves in the Caribbean/eastern Pacific and public escalation over ICE raids that have provoked protests and local pushback; and (6) major legal moments: NY AG Letitia James‚Äô federal arraignment and motions to dismiss/consolidate, and ongoing court fights about presidential immunity and appointment legality.\n\nKey themes and topics discussed in relation to the question\n- Erosion of institutional norms and separation of powers: repeated use of pardons, claims of extraordinary executive authority (including comments about extrajudicial killings of drug traffickers), and high-profile legal challenges about presidential immunity and US attorney appointments [See commentary and legal context: https://x.com/jimsciutto/status/1982039730276462879].\n- Government shutdown consequences: immediate economic and human impacts ‚Äî missing paychecks for federal employees, risk to SNAP benefits for ~42 million Americans, and polling/economic indicators showing rising discontent (inflation ~3% reported this week). Example reporting on SNAP risks: https://x.com/factpostnews/status/1981749106788732964.\n- Militarization and foreign policy brinksmanship: strikes on vessels in the eastern Pacific/Caribbean, increased US air/maritime operations, B-1 bomber activity near Venezuela, and a visible build-up of forces that critics warn could escalate regional conflict. See reports on strikes and surveillance drones: https://x.com/shashj/status/1981331665545785808 and https://x.com/allenanalysis/status/1981847266634944622.\n- Domestic enforcement and protests: aggressive ICE operations triggered local resistance and confrontations across cities, producing strong local reactions and legal/political pushback (e.g., community defense of detainees and preservation portals). Example: NYC/ICE operations and local reactions: https://x.com/MalcolmNance/status/1981826431198822871.\n- Political and diplomatic fallout from trade/tariff decisions: a public spat with Canada over an ad quoting Ronald Reagan led to the administration pausing trade talks; economists and foreign leaders warned of isolationary consequences. See the Reagan ad controversy: https://x.com/allenanalysis/status/1981744845363253455 and reporting on Canada reactions: https://x.com/allenanalysis/status/1981732608565199011.\n- Media, press access, and information institutions under strain: controversy over Pentagon press pool changes, inclusion of fringe outlets/InfoWars in new press access lists, and limited access for reporters to sites like the Ellipse during the demolition. Example: Pentagon press corps concerns and InfoWars inclusion: https://x.com/allenanalysis/status/1981375156007112959 and reporters cleared out of the Ellipse: https://x.com/jimsciutto/status/1981394960185512318.\n\nNotable patterns or trends relevant to the question\n- Concentration of executive action: many major policy moves are being made unilaterally (pardons, troop/strike decisions, construction of the White House ballroom, sanctions/bailouts), increasing legal and political scrutiny.\n- Rapid normalization of aggressive rhetoric and extraordinary claims: public comments advocating lethal action without clear legal authorization, broad immunity claims for federal agents, and talk of extraordinary domestic security forces (a National Guard 'response force') are recurring and accelerating concern about rule-of-law erosion. See the National Guard response force reporting: https://x.com/allenanalysis/status/1981696488821391523 and immunity comments for ICE: https://x.com/allenanalysis/status/1981863624839749713.\n- Political theater feeding policy moves: theatrical elements (high-dollar ballroom, donor-funded troop pay, public pardons) are interacting with governance, creating both transactional questions and large public backlash.\n- Economic pain becoming a central political vulnerability: inflation uptick to 3%, disrupted supply chains and tariffs affecting farmers and consumers, and polling showing historic economic disapproval for the administration this week (sample coverage: https://x.com/allenanalysis/status/1981396000414523631).\n\nImportant mentions, interactions, or data points\n- East Wing demolition/ballroom: multiple on-the-ground reports and photographs documented the complete removal of the East Wing; the project‚Äôs cost has been discussed publicly as $200‚Äì$350M and drew intense criticism that taxpayer money or donor pressure may be involved. Coverage and live images: https://x.com/MeidasTouch/status/1981404980017058050 and https://x.com/factpostnews/status/1981407302268678148.\n- Government shutdown effects: federal employees missing paychecks; SNAP benefits risk for ~42M people; the administration and GOP messaging have prioritized bargaining leverage over piecemeal funding. SNAP risk reporting: https://x.com/factpostnews/status/1981749106788732964.\n- Anonymous donor paying troops: an individual reportedly contributed ~$130M to cover military pay during the shutdown; Pentagon acceptance and use of private funds raised constitutional and transparency concerns. Reporting on donation: https://x.com/allenanalysis/status/1981848690932523337 and presidential remarks: https://x.com/Acyn/status/1981463370558755229.\n- Pardons and clemency: President pardoned Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (guilty plea for money-laundering) and has issued pardons for many Jan. 6 defendants, generating criticism about favoritism and national security risks. Coverage: https://x.com/allenanalysis/status/1981386119527673918.\n- Military/law-enforcement action in Western Hemisphere: lethal strikes on suspected smuggling vessels and increased surveillance/drone flights over Gaza cease-fire monitoring and Caribbean patrols ‚Äî critics warn of escalation without clear authorization. Example: strikes and summaries: https://x.com/shashj/status/1981331665545785808 and https://x.com/allenanalysis/status/1981847266634944622.\n- Trade and diplomacy: Trump halted trade talks with Canada after an Ontario/Canada ad used Reagan quotes criticizing tariffs; the dispute led to high-level pushback, including Canada saying it must reconsider economic ties ‚Äî a notable break in alliance management. See the ad and fallout: https://x.com/allenanalysis/status/1981744845363253455 and https://x.com/allenanalysis/status/1981732608565199011.\n- Letitia James federal arraignment: NY Attorney General Letitia James pleaded not guilty to federal mortgage-fraud charges and moved to dismiss/consolidate, claiming vindictive prosecution; the case was set for significant hearings and referred across circuits for reassignment. Reporting and court timeline: https://x.com/kyledcheney/status/1981750885957955727 and https://x.com/allenanalysis/status/1981818225709965737.\n- Economic indicators and polling: CPI reported ~3% annual inflation for September (up from 2.9%), and multiple polls put the president's economic approval in historic net-negative territory for a sitting president at this stage. Snapshot: https://x.com/MeidasTouch/status/1981715186240106847 and https://x.com/allenanalysis/status/1981396000414523631.\n- Sanctions and international actions: Treasury sanctions on Colombia's president and family were announced this week, a major diplomatic/legal escalation with regional implications: https://x.com/allenanalysis/status/1981864168191074458.\n\nSignificant events ‚Äî one-paragraph highlights\n- White House East Wing demolition and the ballroom project: The administration oversaw the full demolition of the East Wing to make way for an expansive ballroom project (public cost estimates shifted from roughly $200M to $350M). The move provoked immediate bipartisan outrage over legality, transparency, and priorities while photographers and journalists were temporarily restricted from the Ellipse during demolition.

Amid that, the Pentagon accepted ~$130M from a private donor to cover some troop pay ‚Äî an extraordinary temporary fix that raised questions about precedent, oversight, and executive reliance on private funds.

The episode crystallized the week‚Äôs theme of bilateral friction tied to trade policy and political messaging.

This sits alongside broader concern over pardons for Jan. 6 defendants and the broader message such clemencies send about accountability.

Critics warned the moves risk regional escalation and lack clear congressional authorization.

Those moves have sharpened domestic political polarization, provoked legal fights, and created diplomatic friction with allies ‚Äî while economic indicators and polling show mounting political costs. If anything stands out as a trend, it is an accelerated willingness by the administration to act unilaterally in ways that prompt legal, congressional, and public pushback; expect those battles to intensify in the coming days.
