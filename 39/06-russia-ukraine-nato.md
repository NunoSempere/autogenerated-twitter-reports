Direct answer

Recent tweet activity shows a clear escalation along two connected fronts: (1) intensifying Ukrainian deep-strike and drone campaigns striking Russian military and energy infrastructure well inside Russia’s borders, producing tangible effects on Russian fuel supplies and logistics; and (2) widening security concerns across NATO Europe from drone and airspace incursions, prompting stronger allied defensive measures, closer operational cooperation with Ukraine, and political/diplomatic friction inside the EU/NATO family.

Key themes and topics

- Drone and unmanned warfare as the central dynamic: Ukrainian attack and interceptor drones are repeatedly credited with destroying Russian vehicles, fuel infrastructure, smokestacks and refineries, while Russia continues to use mass Shahed-style raids and guided aerial munitions. Examples: Ukrainian multicopters and bomber drones hitting Russian targets; Ukrainian interceptor drone units and a new Air Defence Unmanned Systems branch being formed under the Air Force command [formation of branch and interceptor success](https://x.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1971652998553100618) and UAV strikes on Russian infrastructure [Apaches striking smokestacks](https://x.com/wartranslated/status/1971904841753784807).

- Strategic targeting of Russian energy/logistics nodes: Multiple strikes hit refineries, pumping stations and distribution hubs (Afipsky refinery, Tingovatovo/Tyingovatovo pumping station, other southern refineries), causing refinery damage and gasoline shortages across many Russian regions including Crimea and Russia’s Far East [Afipsky/refinery strikes and pipeline pumping station reports](https://x.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1971803993744572594) and [Reuters on gasoline shortages](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1971770519818273046).

- NATO/European airspace incursions and hybrid threats: Drones and mysterious UAVs have been detected over/near Denmark, Poland, Romania, Sweden, Finland, Lithuania and other NATO/EU countries, prompting NATO/European reactions (Eastern Guardian initiative, plans for a “drone wall” and intensified air patrols). NATO and European leaders say they are learning from Ukrainian counter-drone tactics because shooting down low-cost drones with expensive missiles is unsustainable [airspace incidents and initiative coverage](https://x.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1971905666345214040) and [EU "drone wall" planning](https://x.com/POLITICOEurope/status/1971594282126504040).

- Rising NATO readiness and cooperation with Ukraine: NATO/Allies are increasing patrols and deployments (P‑8s and tankers in the Baltic/near Kaliningrad), cooperating with Ukraine on counter-drone measures, and stepping up defense production and aid (e.g., Denmark’s $407M aid package to Ukraine) [P‑8 patrols near Kaliningrad](https://x.com/Osinttechnical/status/1971712237196005474) and [Denmark aid package](https://x.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1971728495148413227).

- Political/diplomatic friction in Europe: Russia’s hybrid campaign (disinformation, cyberattacks, election meddling) is visible — Moldova’s election and cyberattack worries, Hungarian-Ukrainian border/diplomacy tensions, domestic EU disagreements (Hungary potentially blocking measures) — complicating EU unity on sanctions and support [Moldova election and cyberattack concerns](https://x.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1971713395192680895) and [political blocking of EU measures](https://x.com/POLITICOEurope/status/1971643238348951650).

Notable patterns and trends

- Weaponization of logistics: Ukraine is systematically striking Russia’s fuel/refining base and transport to degrade Moscow’s ability to sustain the war; reporting links multiple hits across many refineries and shows growing shortages and distribution disruptions in Russia [analysis and reports on refinery campaign and shortages](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1971710121718767798).

- Drone-driven attrition: UAVs (attack and reconnaissance) are shaping tactics and force structure on both sides — Russian self-propelled artillery is reportedly less present near the front due to vulnerability, tanks are being converted into armored transports without guns, and both sides adapt with counter-UAV methods and novel small-arms/launcher modifications [Russian artillery and tank adaptations](https://x.com/ChrisO_wiki/status/1971909392020000845) and [Ukrainian drone effects on vehicles](https://x.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1971819091569602767).

- Cost asymmetry problem for NATO air defenses: Leaders warn it’s unsustainable to intercept low-cost drones with high-end missiles; NATO is turning to cheaper, Ukrainian-proven solutions and exploring broader layered defenses [Rutte on costs and learning from Ukraine](https://x.com/EuromaidonPress/status/1971698296486801719) (tweet thread quoting Dutch leadership; also see related Rutte quotes at https://x.com/Mylovanov/status/1971671264680202508).

- Hybrid and maritime-sabotage worries: Intelligence/press reports that Russian assets (e.g., Yantar) have been mapping undersea cables and preparing sabotage, reinforcing allied concerns over cyber/undersea vulnerabilities and prompting countermeasures [Yantar/undersea cable reporting](https://x.com/Gerashchenko_en/status/1971863624307073275).

Separately, Zelensky privately asked for Tomahawk/TLAM-class long-range missiles during recent diplomatic talks; allied responses appear mixed — some U.S. officials signalled openness while reporting shows hesitation and no firm commitment yet [WSJ/Axios/NOELreports on Tomahawks and U.S. signals](https://x.com/NOELreports/status/1971654893573460416) and coverage of conflicting signals (e.g., Axios/wartranslated reporting).

Significant events (one-paragraph highlights)

1) Ukraine’s campaign against Russian fuel and refining infrastructure: Over recent weeks Ukraine has used drones and deep-strike assets to hit multiple refineries, pumping stations and fuel hubs across Russia (Afipsky refinery, pumping stations like Tingovatovo), reportedly degrading over 20% of some refining capacities, triggering gasoline shortages across 10+ Russian regions (including Crimea and the Far East) and forcing temporary suspension of services at damaged facilities. This campaign is presented in tweets and press pieces as a deliberate effort to damage Russia’s logistics and sustainment of its forces [examples and reporting on refinery campaign and regional shortages](https://x.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1971803993744572594) and [Reuters coverage of shortages](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1971770519818273046).

2) NATO/EU alarm over drone incursions and hybrid attacks, and allied countermeasures: A wave of drone sightings and incursions across NATO airspace (Poland, Romania, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Lithuania, Estonia and others) has pushed NATO and EU partners to raise alerts, increase air patrols (P‑8s and large air operations), coordinate counter-drone measures with Ukraine’s practitioners, and consider new infrastructure defenses (e.g., proposals for a Europe ‘drone wall’). Leaders warn these incidents are part of a broader Russian hybrid campaign — including cyberattacks and undersea-sabotage reconnaissance — increasing political pressure to harden Europe’s defenses and deepen cooperation with Ukraine [airspace incidents and allied responses](https://x.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1971905666345214040) and [EU drone-wall planning](https://x.com/POLITICOEurope/status/1971594282126504040).

3) Political and diplomatic friction within the West and mixed signals on long‑range strike support: High-level diplomacy is active — Zelensky’s recent meetings with U.S. leaders and European partners produced expressions of support, coordination (e.g., with Denmark) and renewed sanctions discussion — but there are mixed signals about providing long‑range strike weapons (Tomahawks). Reports indicate Zelensky asked for such missiles and that U.S. responses are cautious and not yet firm; at the same time some Western leaders emphasize stronger commitments to defend Europe and help Ukraine, while internal EU disagreements (e.g., Hungary) complicate bloc-level decisions on sanctions and asset-use mechanisms [Zelensky with U.S./Denmark and Tomahawk reporting](https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1971560224151494845) [and U.S. reporting on Tomahawks/mixed signals](https://x.com/NOELreports/status/1971654893573460416).

Overall assessment (short)

Tweets collectively portray a war increasingly dominated by drones, long‑range strikes into Russian territory focused on energy/logistics nodes, and rising concerns across NATO Europe about hybrid and airspace violations. Allied responses show increased operational cooperation with Ukraine (especially on counter‑drone tactics), more patrols and defensive initiatives, and intensified political debate over how far to escalate support (including whether to approve long‑range strike systems). The immediate trend is continued pressure on Russian logistics and growing allied preparedness to defend NATO airspace and critical infrastructure.
