Direct answer
Last week saw a mix of diplomatic movement on pledges (notably new 2035 commitments that together now cover roughly half of global emissions), intense political pushback from the U.S. administration, and multiple high-impact climate-related events: record heat and wildfire damage in Europe, rapid intensification of a Pacific super-typhoon, and ongoing signals from scientists and agencies that current pledges still fall short of 1.5°C limits.

Key themes and topics
- Diplomatic momentum and pledges: China and other countries announced new near‑term pledges at the UN/Climate Week, substantially increasing the share of global emissions covered by commitments through 2035 (CarbonBrief analysis: half of global emissions covered) [China/2035 pledges](https://x.com/CarbonBrief/status/1971549259968221503). The UNFCCC noted ~100 Parties (about two‑thirds of global emissions) have submitted or unveiled new NDCs ahead of COP30 [UNFCCC on NDCs](https://x.com/UNFCCC/status/1971146057406091320).

- Political contestation: U.S. domestic policy and rhetoric generated headlines and scientist rebuttals—President Trump’s UN speech denying mainstream climate findings drew widespread criticism from climate scientists and communicators; scientists published op‑eds and rebuttals calling the speech misinformation [scientist response](https://x.com/MichaelEMann/status/1971573846882070975). Climate advocates flagged rollbacks and attempted regulatory changes (EPA/DOE) while courts, lawsuits, and public pressure continued to shape outcomes.

- Extreme weather and impacts: Europe experienced extraordinary heat and significant wildfire losses; Germany alone lost >14,000 hectares to fire this year so far, with much larger footprints across Europe — experts cite climate change as a major driver (Waldbrandexpert Christopher Reyer) [German wildfires](https://x.com/rahmstorf/status/1971893845685055630). Independent reporting linked this summer’s extreme heat in Europe to thousands of excess deaths (Eos/summary) [heat deaths report](https://x.com/dwallacewells/status/1971583696546517102). In the tropics, Super Typhoon Ragasa underwent extreme rapid intensification tied to unusually warm sea surface temperatures; atmospheric/ocean heat content made such intensification much more likely [Ragasa rapid intensification](https://x.com/ClimateCentral/status/1971233683622502557).

- Science, data and tools: Researchers and science communicators pushed visualizations and new findings—maps showing regional warming patterns (Ed Hawkins visuals) and national warming (Germany ~+2.5°C since 1881 vs global ~+1.3°C) were highlighted [warming visuals/maps](https://x.com/rahmstorf/status/1971852715480535084) [Germany warming note](https://x.com/rahmstorf/status/1971829722025021684). New and archival science on deep‑time proxies, carbon storage limits, adaptation benefits (fewer flood deaths), and data‑driven tools (generational warming tool, WeatherPower, data‑center energy charts) were circulated widely.

Notable patterns and trends
- Converging evidence of increased extremes: heat waves, wildfire seasons, and more frequent/intense tropical cyclones were repeatedly linked to human‑caused warming by multiple outlets and researchers.

- Policy and pledges growing but still insufficient: countries are submitting more near‑term pledges (raising coverage to roughly half of emissions to 2035), yet independent assessments and scientific voices warn the current mix of pledges and policies does not secure the 1.5°C pathway (and many officials/analyses highlight a gap to get there) [CarbonBrief spotlight on COP30 and pledges](https://x.com/CarbonBrief/status/1971568220760076443).

- Political friction in major emitters: progress on pledges and market signals (renewables growth) is occurring alongside political resistance and regulatory rollbacks in some governments, creating mixed near‑term prospects for implementation.

Significant events / developments (each in one paragraph)
- China‑led/new 2035 pledges and broader NDC submissions: At the UN/Climate Week, several countries (led in coverage by China’s announcements) unveiled new or updated near‑term climate pledges that CarbonBrief says now cover roughly half of global emissions through 2035; the UNFCCC also highlighted ~100 Parties submitting new NDCs (~two‑thirds of emissions), a concrete signal of diplomatic momentum ahead of COP30 but not yet a guarantee of policy implementation or 1.5°C compliance [China/2035 pledges](https://x.com/CarbonBrief/status/1971549259968221503) [UNFCCC NDCs](https://x.com/UNFCCC/status/1971146057406091320).

- Political backlash and scientific rebuttal at the UN: President Trump’s UN statement dismissing much climate science triggered rapid rebuttals from scientists and communicators, op‑eds condemning misinformation, and intensified debate over U.S. domestic rollbacks of climate protections. This week highlighted how political leadership can either accelerate or hinder global climate credibility and action; scientists emphasized that the evidence and peer‑reviewed science remain clear [scientist response to UN speech](https://x.com/MichaelEMann/status/1971573846882070975).

- Heat, wildfires and health impacts in Europe: Europe experienced extraordinary heat extremes that set or shattered records, worsened wildfire seasons, and contributed to widespread impacts — reporting noted thousands of heat‑related deaths this summer and large burned areas (Germany >14,000 ha). Scientists and experts repeatedly linked these events to human‑caused warming, and emergency/health systems and adaptation measures were highlighted as crucial short‑term responses [German wildfire summary](https://x.com/rahmstorf/status/1971893845685055630) [heat deaths reporting](https://x.com/dwallacewells/status/1971583696546517102).

- Rapid storm intensification in the western Pacific: Super Typhoon Ragasa rapidly intensified over unusually warm sea surface temperatures, becoming one of the strongest tropical systems observed this year; analyses stressed that ocean warming made such rapid intensification far more likely, underscoring how warming oceans amplify tropical cyclone risks and impacts on vulnerable regions [Ragasa intensification and ocean heat context](https://x.com/ClimateCentral/status/1971233683622502557).

Concluding assessment
Last week’s coverage and events underlined a mixed picture: diplomatic momentum and new pledges are important and growing (more countries updating NDCs), but the science and climate impacts (extreme heat, fires, super‑typhoon rapid intensification) make clear that current policies and pledges still risk overshooting safe warming limits. Political pushback and rollbacks in major economies create additional implementation risk even as renewables, adaptation gains, and new data/tools show pathways and benefits of accelerated action. The net message: action and implementation must accelerate immediately to translate new pledges into emissions trajectories consistent with avoiding the worst impacts.
