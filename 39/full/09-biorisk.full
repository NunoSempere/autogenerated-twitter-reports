      "filter_question": "Is this tweet talking about a disease outbreak, new paper, administrative action, etc?",
      "summarization_question": "Summarize biorisk news last week",
      "summary": "Direct answer — what happened last week (biorisk highlights):\n\n- Avian influenza (H5N1) continued as a major biorisk focus with expanding detections in poultry, wildlife and pets, plus related control actions. Multiple U.S. commercial flocks and backyard/wild bird detections were reported (including a planned cull of ~3 million chickens in Jefferson County, WI) and USDA surveillance updates across states were posted; there were also confirmed HPAI detections in California and Minnesota turkey operations and reports of H5 in dairy cattle surveillance activities. Importantly, clusters of H5N1 in domestic cats in Los Angeles were linked to raw pet food, prompting public warnings and sequencing work to track genotypes (B3.13) — an animal-to-pet spillover and possible foodborne exposure concern. See examples: [Wisconsin cull / H5N1 poultry](https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1971774449021030725), [USDA surveillance / dairy cattle testing](https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1971775135964381348), [LA county cat cluster / raw pet food link (CIDRAP)](https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1971643140143562856) and [LA County Public Animal Health blog on raw cat food link](https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1971613912371233234).\n\n- Measles resurged as a key human-transmitted risk: CDC-confirmed U.S. case counts rose (CDC reports adding 23 cases last week with the 2025 total topping ~1,500), multiple local clusters and continuing low MMR coverage in some areas were highlighted, and CDC began publishing measles detections in wastewater to support early action. These developments underline persistent immunity gaps and the risk of larger outbreaks. See: [CDC confirms 23 more US measles cases / >1,500 total](https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1970956930991407303) and [CDC wastewater measles detections announcement](https://x.com/CDC_NCEZID/status/1971628493545890143).\n\n- Ebola in the DRC / new Congo outbreak: reporting indicated a worsening Ebola outbreak in Congo with dozens of deaths and repeated warnings about insufficient funding for response activities; situation reports and WHO/partner operational updates continued. See: [DRC Ebola situation report](https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1971777048432754934) and [statnews on Congo Ebola outbreak worsening / funding gaps](https://x.com/statnews/status/1971392558493323654).\n\n- Other emerging and re-emerging zoonotic/vector-borne threats: West Nile activity (new human cases in Italy and Massachusetts), first Powassan virus case in Illinois, dengue surges in Pakistan/Nepal/Bangladesh/Cuba, bluetongue detections in UK livestock, and an uptick in cholera in Mozambique and Chad with vaccine campaigns in Sudan highlighted broader seasonal and geographic spread of vector-borne and waterborne risks. See: [Italy West Nile report](https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1971775967468441834), [Powassan first case Illinois](https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1971432681964745098), [Cholera Mozambique declared again](https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1971680265174241512), and [Chad cholera surge / Sudan vaccine campaign](https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1971306707872625084).\n\n- Uncommon agricultural/animal pests and One Health threats: New World screwworm (NWS) continues spreading north from Central America, prompting a multi-pronged USDA protection plan to guard livestock, wildlife and public health; chronic wasting disease (CWD) expanded in Michigan; and bluetongue, H1N2 spillover into turkeys, and STEC foodborne outbreaks in Belgium nursing homes were also reported. See: [USDA NWS plan](https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1971445608033722388) and [Michigan CWD counties update](https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1970942259852898729).\n\n- Viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) and preparedness messaging: CDC and partners emphasized IPC and response capacity for VHFs (Marburg, CCHF, others) as CCHF was detected in animals in southern France and VHF guidance was shared to strengthen outbreak control. See: [CCHF in animals, France](https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1971248176947466365) and [CDC VHF IPC messaging](https://x.com/CDC_NCEZID/status/1971247137636683833).\n\n- Influenza, RSV, pediatric flu burden and vaccine updates: WHO released recommendations for 2026 southern hemisphere influenza vaccine composition; CDC/others highlighted that the 2024–25 pediatric influenza season was the deadliest in more than a decade for U.S. children; new data confirmed nirsevimab is ~77% protective against RSV hospitalization in infants. These items reflect ongoing vaccine-strain decisions, RSV prevention advances and severe pediatric respiratory disease burden. See: [WHO influenza composition recommendations](https://x.com/WHO/status/1971478546800689266), [CDC / reports on deadly pediatric flu season (CIDRAP)](https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1971677247653232892), and [nirsevimab protection study](https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1971311214257967231).\n\n- Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and One Health funding/efforts: The EU launched a $276M One Health AMR initiative and AfricaCDC and West African partners advanced regional AMR communities of practice — reflecting sustained investment and policy focus on AMR as a cross-sectoral biorisk. See: [EU One Health AMR initiative](https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1970952825996755407) and [Africa CDC AMR Community of Practice in West Africa](https://x.com/AfricaCDC/status/1970488976319344687).\n\nKey themes and patterns observed:\n- Zoonotic spillover and cross-species transmission remained prominent (H5N1 in birds → domestic animals/pets; H1N2 spillover from swine to turkeys; CCHF and other arboviruses in animals), emphasizing continued risk at the human–animal interface.\n- Seasonal amplification of vector-borne and respiratory threats (West Nile, Powassan, dengue, influenza, RSV, pediatric flu) drove simultaneous multi-pathogen pressure on public health systems in multiple regions.\n- Persistent immunity and vaccination gaps (measles, low MMR coverage pockets) continue to create high biorisk for highly transmissible vaccine-preventable diseases.\n- One Health and cross-sector responses (AMR initiatives, USDA NWS plan, AfricaCDC surveillance and outbreak coordination) expanded — indicating stronger institutional attention to integrated biorisk management.\n- Food-chain and pet-related exposures (raw pet food linked to cat H5N1 clusters; STEC in nursing homes tied to minced beef) highlighted food safety as an important biorisk pathway.\n\nNotable/high-significance developments (each summarized):\n1) H5N1 avian influenza surge and pet spillover: Widespread H5N1 detections in US poultry, wild birds, and recent clusters in domestic cats (including genotype B3.13 in L.A.) linked to raw pet food triggered large-scale control measures (culling, surveillance, import suspensions) and public warnings to avoid contact with sick/dead birds and unsafe pet foods. This pattern raises concerns about continued epizootic spread, food-associated exposures, and potential for novel mammalian infections. See the cluster and warnings: [CIDRAP cat H5N1 deaths / LA warning](https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1971643140143562856) and [Wisconsin poultry cull](https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1971774449021030725).\n\n2) Measles resurgence and wastewater surveillance: The U.S. measles total exceeded 1,500 cases for 2025 with new clusters and ongoing low MMR coverage in some communities; CDC’s rollout of wastewater measles detection is a meaningful step toward earlier outbreak detection and response. See: [CDC measles cases update](https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1970956930991407303) and [CDC wastewater measles detections tool](https://x.com/CDC_NCEZID/status/1971628493545890143).\n\n3) Ebola in Congo and funding/response limitations: New/ongoing Ebola activity in DRC/Congo killed dozens and responders warned of insufficient funds hampering control efforts — a reminder that resource gaps can quickly undermine response to high-consequence pathogens. See: [StatNews on Congo Ebola outbreak worsening](https://x.com/statnews/status/1971392558493323654) and [DRC situation report](https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1971777048432754934).\n\nOther important mentions / interactions / data points:\n- CDC and WHO messaging on VHFs, IPC, and respiratory pathogens; WHO influenza strain picks and vaccine composition recommendations for the southern hemisphere; CDC and public-health bodies flagged fungal disease underdiagnosis, antimicrobial stewardship and One Health investments; AfricaCDC advanced surveillance, AMR coordination and child health initiatives at UNGA. Examples: [WHO influenza composition](https://x.com/WHO/status/1971478546800689266), [CDC VHF IPC guidance](https://x.com/CDC_NCEZID/status/1971247137636683833), and [AfricaCDC surveillance and program launches](https://x.com/AfricaCDC/status/1970065814385553730).\n\nOverall assessment: Last week’s biorisk landscape showed multiple, overlapping threats across animal, human and environmental interfaces — avian influenza (with pet and livestock implications), measles resurgence, worsening Ebola in Congo, seasonal vector-borne disease activity, and persistent AMR and food-safety vulnerabilities. Response emphasis was on enhanced surveillance (including wastewater), One Health coordination, vaccine updates and targeted public health actions (culling, import restrictions, vaccination campaigns), but resource and immunity gaps remain critical vulnerabilities."
