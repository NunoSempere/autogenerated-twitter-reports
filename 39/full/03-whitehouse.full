Monaco has been shockingly hired as the President of Global Affairs for Microsoft, in a very senior role with access to Highly Sensitive Information. Monaco's having that kind of access is unacceptable, and cannot be allowed to stand. She is a menace to U.S. National Security, especially given the major contracts that Microsoft has with the United States Government. Because of Monaco's many wrongful acts, the U.S. Government recently stripped her of all Security Clearances, took away all of her access to National Security Intelligence, and banned her from all Federal Properties. It is my opinion that Microsoft should immediately terminate the employment of Lisa Monaco. Thank you for your attention to this matter! President DJT",

She was an Aviation Pioneer, the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean, and achieved many other Aviation \"firsts.\" She disappeared in the South Pacific while trying to become the first woman to fly around the World. Amelia made it almost three quarters around the World before she suddenly, and without notice, vanished, never to be seen again. Her disappearance, almost 90 years ago, has captivated millions. I am ordering my Administration to declassify and release all Government Records related to Amelia Earhart, her final trip, and everything else about her. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\n\nDONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA",

First, the escalator going up to the Main Speaking Floor came to a screeching halt. It stopped on a dime. It's amazing that Melania and I didn't fall forward onto the sharp edges of these steel steps, face first. It was only that we were each holding the handrail tightly or, it would have been a disaster. This was absolutely sabotage, as noted by a day's earlier \"post\" in The London Times that said UN workers \"joked about turning off an escalator.\" The people that did it should be arrested! Then, as I stood before a Television crowd of millions of people all over the World, and important Leaders in the Hall, my teleprompter didn't work. It was stone cold dark. I immediately thought to myself, \"Wow, first the escalator event, and now a bad teleprompter. What kind of a place is this?\" I then proceeded to make a Speech without a teleprompter, which kicked in about 15 minutes later. The good news is the Speech has gotten fantastic reviews. Maybe they appreciated the fact that very few people could have done what I did. And third, after making the Speech, I was told that the sound was completely off in the Auditorium where the Speech was made, that World Leaders, unless they used the interpreters' earpieces, couldn't hear a thing. The first person I saw at the conclusion of the Speech was Melania, who was sitting right up front. I said, \"How did I do?\" And she said, \"I couldn't hear a word you said.\" This wasn't a coincidence, this was triple sabotage at the UN. They ought to be ashamed of themselves. I'm sending a copy of this letter to the Secretary General, and I demand an immediate investigation. No wonder the United Nations hasn't been able to do the job that they were put in existence to do. All security tapes at the escalator should be saved, especially the emergency stop button. The Secret Service is involved. Thank you for your attention to this matter!",

This is despicable! The Brave Men and Women of ICE are just trying to do their jobs, and remove the \"WORST of the WORST\" Criminals out of our Country, but they are facing an unprecedented increase in threats, violence, and attacks by Deranged Radical Leftists. This violence is the result of the Radical Left Democrats constantly demonizing Law Enforcement, calling for ICE to be demolished, and comparing ICE Officers to \"Nazis.\" The continuing violence from Radical Left Terrorists, in the aftermath of Charlie Kirk's assassination, must be stopped. ICE Officers, and other Brave Members of Law Enforcement, are under grave threat. We have already declared ANTIFA a Terrorist Organization, and I will be signing an Executive Order this week to dismantle these Domestic Terrorism Networks. I AM CALLING ON ALL DEMOCRATS TO STOP THIS RHETORIC AGAINST ICE AND AMERICA'S LAW ENFORCEMENT, RIGHT NOW! The Trump Administration is fully committed to backing Law Enforcement, Strong Borders, securing our Homeland, deporting Violent Illegal Criminals, and fully rooting out the Left Wing Domestic Terrorism that is terrorizing our Country. Thank you for your attention to this matter!",

In fact, it is very much making them look like \"a paper tiger.\" When the people living in Moscow, and all of the Great Cities, Towns, and Districts all throughout Russia, find out what is really going on with this War, the fact that it's almost impossible for them to get Gasoline through the long lines that are being formed, and all of the other things that are taking place in their War Economy, where most of their money is being spent on fighting Ukraine, which has Great Spirit, and only getting better, Ukraine would be able to take back their Country in its original form and, who knows, maybe even go further than that! Putin and Russia are in BIG Economic trouble, and this is the time for Ukraine to act. In any event, I wish both Countries well.

Where migrants have violated laws, lodged false asylum claims, or claimed refugee status for illegitimate reasons, they should in many cases be SENT HOME.

They are threatening to shut down the Government of the United States unless they can have over $1 Trillion Dollars in new spending to continue free healthcare for Illegal Aliens (A monumental cost!), force Taxpayers to fund Transgender surgery for minors, have dead people on the Medicaid roles, allow Illegal Alien Criminals to steal Billions of Dollars in American Taxpayer Benefits, try to force our Country to again open our Borders to Criminals and to the World, allow men to play in women's sports, and essentially create Transgender operations for everybody. These Radical Left Views and Policies is what allowed me to win the Presidential Election, including all seven Swing States, and the Popular Vote, IN A HISTORIC LANDSLIDE. There are consequences to losing Elections but, based on their letter to me, the Democrats haven't figured that out yet. They are trying to eliminate the popular $50 Billion Dollar Rural and Vulnerable Hospital Fund, which was passed with only Republican Votes, and proudly signed into Law by ME. The Democrats in Congress seem to have totally lost their way. They obviously have no idea what it means to put America First or to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! All Congressional Democrats want to do is enact Radical Left Policies that nobody voted for — High Taxes, Open Borders, No Consequences for Violent Criminals, Men in Women's Sports, Taxpayer funded \"TRANSGENDER\" surgery, and much more. Few people voted for what they represent, which would lead to the destruction of America. Instead, people voted for COMMON SENSE, and that's what the Republicans and your President, \"DONALD J. TRUMP,\" stand for. I look forward to meeting with them if they get serious about the future of our Nation. We must keep the Government open, and legislate like true Patriots rather than hold American Citizens hostage, knowing that they want our now thriving Country closed. I'll be happy to meet with them if they agree to the Principles in this Letter. They must do their job! Otherwise, it will just be another long and brutal slog through their radicalized quicksand. To the Leaders of the Democrat Party, the ball is in your court. I look forward to meeting with you when you become realistic about the things that our Country stands for. DO THE RIGHT THING!\n\nDONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA",

Antifa as a Terrorist Threat.  Antifa is amilitarist, anarchist enterprise that explicitly calls for the overthrow of the United States Government, law enforcement authorities, and our system of law.  It uses illegal means to organize and execute a campaign of violence and terrorism nationwide to accomplish these goals.  This campaign involves coordinated efforts to obstruct enforcement of Federal laws through armed standoffs with law enforcement, organized riots, violent assaults on Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other law enforcement officers, and routine doxing of and other threats against political figures and activists. Antifa recruits, trains, and radicalizes young Americans to engage in this violence and suppression of political activity, then employs elaborate means and mechanisms to shield the identities of its operatives, conceal its funding sources and operations in an effort to frustrate law enforcement, and recruit additional members.  Individuals associated with and acting on behalf of Antifa further coordinate with other organizations and entities for the purpose of spreading, fomenting, and advancing political violence and suppressing lawful political speech.  This organized effort designed to achieve policy objectives by coercion and intimidation is domestic terrorism.\n\n​Sec. 2. Designation as a Domestic Terrorist Organization.  Because of the aforementioned pattern of political violence designed to suppress lawful political activity and obstruct the rule of law, I hereby designate Antifa as a \"domestic terrorist organization.\"  All relevant executive departments and agencies shall utilize all applicable authorities to investigate, disrupt, and dismantle any and all illegal operations --especially those involving terrorist actions -- conducted by Antifa or any person claiming to act on behalf of Antifa, or for which Antifa or any person claiming to act on behalf of Antifa provided material support, including necessary investigatory and prosecutorial actions against those who fund such operations.\n\nSec. 3. General Provisions.  (a)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law.  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n\n(b)  This order shall be published in the Federal Register.\n\nDONALD J.

      "summary": "This week the White House is focused on a mix of aggressive domestic security actions, high-profile foreign diplomacy at the U.N., big economic/trade moves, and a sustained messaging campaign aimed at blocking a Democratic-driven government shutdown.\n\nTop-line answer: The administration is prioritizing (1) national security and law-and-order measures (including designating and directing whole-of-government action against left‑wing networks), (2) high-visibility diplomacy and peacemaking at the U.N. (efforts to secure a Gaza deal and meetings with world leaders), (3) protectionist trade and industrial policy (new and threatened tariffs, incentives for domestic pharma capacity), and (4) domestic policy initiatives on public health, education, and transportation — all amplified by repeated public warnings about the consequences of a government shutdown. Key public announcements include an Antifa domestic-terrorist designation and associated counterterrorism strategy, an executive order/deal to keep TikTok operating under American control, and sharp tariff pronouncements (notably a proposed 100% pharma tariff unless plants are built in the U.S.).\n\nMajor national-security / law-and-order actions (significant events):\n- The President and administration rolled out an \"all-of-government\" strategy to investigate, disrupt, and dismantle what they describe as left‑wing organized political violence and designated Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization; the move and the accompanying fact sheet and memorandum are central to the week’s agenda and are repeatedly promoted by the White House and press office (see the Antifa designation and rollout here: https://x.com/PressSec/status/1970258229734318453 and text circulated by RapidResponse47: https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1970250137193644374).  This has been paired with strong rhetoric blaming \"radical left\" rhetoric for recent attacks on law enforcement and ICE facilities and with calls for tougher prosecutorial action.\n- Linked enforcement directives include an order directing the Attorney General and U.S. Attorneys to pursue capital punishment in D.C. in appropriate cases and other firm prosecutorial stances (see: https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1971321346375418125).\n\nForeign policy and U.N. diplomacy (significant events):\n- The President delivered a major address at the U.N. General Assembly and conducted a series of bilateral meetings (Turkey’s Erdoğan, Ukraine’s Zelenskyy, EU and NATO interlocutors). The administration is touting progress toward a Gaza hostage deal and broader Middle East negotiations, and is positioning the President as an active peacemaker (see his U.N. remarks and related messaging: https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1970490427900846580 and the hostage/peace messaging: https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1971702568050176070).  This theme includes calls for the U.N. to be more action‑oriented and frequent public pressure on allies to cut Russian energy purchases if needed.\n\nTrade, industry, and economic policy:\n- The White House is loudly promoting strong economic data (Q2 GDP revised up to 3.8%) to argue that administration policies are working; that data point is cited repeatedly in tweets and briefings (see: https://x.com/PressSec/status/1971582162567827488 and https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1971706546670510087).\n- The administration announced or threatened a range of tariffs and trade measures: a high-profile statement of a 100% tariff on branded/patented pharmaceuticals starting Oct 1, 2025 unless a company is already building U.S. manufacturing capacity (https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1971355989711651294), other product tariffs (kitchen cabinets, heavy trucks), and general emphasis on maintaining tariffs to reduce the goods trade deficit. These trade threats are tied to efforts to spur onshoring (Eli Lilly’s investment is highlighted as a success consequence: https://x.com/PressSec/status/1970848766774370466).\n- The administration also announced that an executive order and deal will keep TikTok U.S. access intact while transferring American control of key operations — repeatedly framed as both an economic and national-security win (see: https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1971312721573576815 and related RapidResponse47 posts).\n\nDomestic program and regulatory moves:\n- Public-health and family initiatives: an \"Autism Action Plan,\" FDA guidance flagging a possible link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and autism risk, and promotion of steps on SNAP/food retail to emphasize healthier purchases (see: https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1970268144569819420 and third‑party posts about SNAP changes).\n- Transportation and border enforcement: DOT/Secretary Duffy announced emergency action on non-domiciled commercial driver licenses (CDLs) and the administration pushed protections for domestic truck makers; these are part of a larger push on transportation safety and border enforcement (see: https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1971576550786240676 and https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1971355668767809779).\n- Education and grants: a large charter‑school investment announcement and moves to withdraw some DEI-related environmental grants were publicized by the press office (https://x.com/PressSec/status/1971302550810001761 and https://x.com/PressSec/status/1970843429350601077).\n\nMessaging and political positioning (patterns and trends):\n- Repeated framing of Democrats as responsible for an imminent government shutdown, with targeted warnings that programs for low‑income and Medicare patients (including WIC and home‑treatment programs) could lapse if the Senate blocks a short-term funding bill — this is a dominant theme in White House tweets and press statements (see: https://x.com/PressSec/status/1971683969877119033 and https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1971709114964381958).\n- Strong, consistent law-and-order rhetoric after attacks on ICE and other law-enforcement facilities (administration calls for the political left to curb rhetoric and for local officials to condemn violence; see: https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1970952551144313218 and DHS posts about threats: https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1971678074505757134).\n- Recurrent economic boosterism: linking GDP and consumer-spending beats, falling gas prices, and tariff wins to the \"Golden Age\" narrative and to defend the administration’s policy agenda (see: https://x.com/PressSec/status/1971583785322918312 and many reposts).\n\nNotable interactions and people: visits and meetings with foreign leaders (Erdogan’s White House visit: https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1971242187284512875; Zelenskyy bilateral at UN: https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1970541036377178467), Vice President Vance’s law‑and‑order appearances and promotion of the TikTok deal (https://x.com/VP/status/1971312786031747407), and multiple Cabinet secretaries amplifying the administration’s trade and energy messages (e.g., SecRubio, SecWar, SecKennedy).\n\nOther headline items and one-paragraph treatments for highly significant developments:\n- Antifa designated as a domestic terrorist organization: The administration signed and publicly circulated an executive-level order and fact sheet designating \"Antifa\" as a domestic terrorist threat and directed agencies to use all applicable authorities to investigate, disrupt, and dismantle associated networks. This is being deployed as a centerpiece of the administration’s law-and-order agenda and is tied to warnings about funding sources, prosecutions, and increased enforcement against violent left-wing actors (see: https://x.com/PressSec/status/1970258229734318453 and the full text circulated at https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1970250137193644374).\n\n- TikTok \"save\" executive order / deal: The White House announced an executive order and an arrangement intended to transfer U.S. operations and protect American data while preserving TikTok’s U.S. availability; the administration frames this as both a national-security safeguard and a boon to small businesses that use the platform. The announcement was promoted broadly by the White House and Vice President’s accounts (see: https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1971312721573576815 and https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1971311008934449450).\n\n- Trade/tariff posture and domestic industrial incentives: Multiple high-impact tariff threats were made public this week — the most notable being the stated 100% tariff on branded/patented pharmaceuticals effective Oct 1, 2025, unless companies are actively building U.S. manufacturing (https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1971355989711651294). These pronouncements are being used to pressure onshoring and are tied to administration outreach to industry (Eli Lilly’s U.S. investment was highlighted: https://x.com/PressSec/status/1970848766774370466).\n\nOther important developments and datapoints:\n- Economy: Q2 GDP revision to 3.8% and positive consumer‑spending and inflation messaging are repeated as proof of success (https://x.com/PressSec/status/1971582162567827488).\n- Domestic health and research: Autism Action Plan initiatives, FDA guidance on acetaminophen in pregnancy, and increased federal research and public messaging on autism causes/risks (https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1970268144569819420).\n- Border/enforcement metrics: the administration is publicizing high numbers of removals and declines in crossings, using those figures to justify tougher policies (multiple PressSec posts).\n\nOverall pattern: The White House’s week is a coordinated mix of hardline national-security and immigration enforcement measures, protectionist trade policy and industrial incentives, high-profile diplomacy at the U.N., and aggressive political messaging aimed at portraying the administration as delivering prosperity and security while blaming Democrats for potential disruption (a looming shutdown) and for fostering violent rhetoric. Major announcements (Antifa designation, TikTok arrangement, large threatened tariffs) are being used to drive the administration’s narrative across domestic and international audiences.\n\nSources (selected tweets cited above): Antifa designation and rollout (https://x.com/PressSec/status/1970258229734318453; https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1970250137193644374); TikTok executive order/save (https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1971312721573576815); UNGA speech and diplomatic meetings (https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1970490427900846580; https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1971242187284512875); GDP revision and economic messaging (https://x.com/PressSec/status/1971582162567827488); pharma tariff announcement (https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1971355989711651294); DOJ death-penalty direction in D.C.
