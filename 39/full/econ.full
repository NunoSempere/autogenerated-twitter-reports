(For examples, please see prior posts on Fed officials favoring a move to an inflation range for this part of the dual mandate, as well as an alternative intermediate policy target.)\nWhile very overdue, it's good news to have such deliberations started before the upcoming change in Fed leadership.\n#economy #federalreserve #inflation #Markets",

Be especially wary of this conflict of interest when people are advising you on matters that will affect how much money they earn--such as the lawyer who spends a lot of billable hours giving you advice, or the salesperson who advises you on what to purchase while receiving a commission on the amount that you spend. You can't imagine how many people I meet who are eager to \"help\" me.\n\nDon't be naive. Strive for the highest possible percentage of your population having meaningful work and meaningful relationships while recognizing that there will always be some percentage of the population who won't care for the community and/or will do it harm. #principleoftheday",

      "filter_question": "Is this tweet talking about an important economics development",
      "summarization_question": "What are the key economics events this week?",
      "summary": "Direct answer ‚Äî the key economics events this week:\n\n1) A sweeping new U.S. tariff offensive and trade shock. President Trump announced a large set of fresh tariffs (eg. 100% on certain pharmaceuticals, 50% on kitchen cabinets and bathroom fixtures, 30% on upholstered furniture, 25% on heavy trucks), triggering immediate market and sector moves and sparking alarm in industry and abroad. See one summary of the package [here](https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1971360987501482405). This is the single biggest macro policy story of the week because it can affect inflation pass‚Äëthrough, supply chains, corporate investment decisions, and trade partners‚Äô balances.\n\n- Why it matters: tariffs of this size raise input and consumer prices directly (inflation risk), distort supply chains, prompt corporate relocation/reshoring announcements, and invite retaliation or broader geo‚Äëeconomic responses. Markets and some companies reacted quickly (e.g., retail and furniture names; Restoration Hardware cited) and precious metals rallied amid risk/offshore flows.\n\n2) Fed / inflation story intensified ‚Äî PCE rose and Fed debate widened. The Fed‚Äôs preferred inflation gauge, PCE, ticked up to about 2.7% (core PCE ~2.9%), reversing some easing hopes and feeding an intense debate inside the Fed about the neutral rate and how fast to cut. See the inflation readouts [here](https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1971553211267096755) and commentary on the divided FOMC (Governor Miran‚Äôs speech arguing neutral is materially lower vs. other Fed officials) [here](https://x.com/NickTimiraos/status/1970156734116213055) and [analysis](https://x.com/elerianm/status/1971563659295109240).\n\n- Why it matters: higher-than-target PCE makes the timing and size of rate cuts uncertain. Governor Miran argued that neutral rates are much lower (implying faster easing), while others warned of stickier inflation ‚Äî a split that raises policy risk and market volatility. Separately, the Fed‚Äôs independence has become a political flashpoint with legal action around a Fed governor (a high‚Äëprofile amicus brief from ex‚ÄëFed chairs and Treasury secretaries warns of the consequences) [here](https://x.com/NickTimiraos/status/1971214605662982525).\n\n3) Growth & consumer activity: surprisingly strong GDP revision and consumer spending, but weak sentiment and mixed signals. The Treasury highlighted a Q2 GDP revision to ~3.8% driven by strong consumption and retail [here](https://x.com/USTreasury/status/1971264569214423135). At the same time, consumer sentiment readings plunged to very low levels (UMich/other series and Barchart‚Äôs reported Consumer Sentiment at 55.1) [here](https://x.com/Barchart/status/1971604724324708704), showing a disconnect between hard spending data and household confidence.\n\n- Pattern: strong realized spending and rising money aggregates (M2 showing renewed growth [here](https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1971301428615614546)) alongside low sentiment is a recurring theme ‚Äî consumers are still spending even as many report pessimism, which supports short‚Äërun growth while complicating the inflation outlook.\n\n4) Elevated risk of a U.S. government shutdown and preparations for disruption. Probability markets and commentaries placed shutdown odds high (Kalshi ~63‚Äì67% this week) [see](https://x.com/SpencerHakimian/status/1971630586281578534). The White House reportedly told agencies to prepare for mass firings if Congress does not avert a shutdown [here](https://x.com/unusual_whales/status/1971630094566260749).\n\n- Why it matters: a shutdown would temporarily hit growth, delay economic programs, and could rattle markets if prolonged. Contingency planning (including layoffs) raises the political and economic disruption stakes.\n\n5) Market structure and risk signals ‚Äî concentration, credit, and flows.\n- Very high equity allocations and concentration: household allocation to stocks hit an all‚Äëtime high (66%); top stocks now account for record shares of market cap (top 10% ~78% or Mag‚Äë7 ~35%), increasing systemic concentration risk [see allocation and concentration notes](https://x.com/unusual_whales/status/1971635127592931645) and (https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1971607948783710338).\n- Precious metals surged: silver and gold hit multi‚Äëyear highs (silver ~$46, highest in 14+ years) as safe‚Äëhaven flows rose [silver report](https://x.com/Barchart/status/1971593152776556784) and [gold commentary](https://x.com/elerianm/status/1971603473822265610).\n- Credit & corporate finance: tech bond issuance and investment‚Äëgrade spreads remain tight; large corporate deals and potential IPO/funding moves (EA takeover reports ~ $50bn LBO [WSJ summary](https://x.com/WSJ/status/1971645350088745121); Kraken funding talks [here](https://x.com/business/status/1971661057941815710); Ethos IPO filing [here](https://x.com/business/status/1971641004722708881)).\n\n6) Sovereign and regional credit moves: France‚Äôs rating outlook pressure, Morocco‚Äôs upgrade, and UN sanctions on Iran. Scope Ratings put a negative outlook on France amid political impasse [France note](https://x.com/business/status/1971681822242181470), while S&P upgraded or affirmed Morocco as an African Eurobond issuer [here](https://x.com/business/status/1971682371196916023). The UN moves to reimpose broad sanctions on Iran also made global risk headlines [here](https://x.com/business/status/1971661254436565215).\n\n7) Notable policy and institutional items: DOJ antitrust pressure on Google display ad business [here](https://x.com/business/status/1971655557799891307); the NLRB dropped an allegation against Apple/Tim Cook signaling a more business‚Äëfriendly enforcement posture [here](https://x.com/business/status/1971671230919872698); IMF/World Bank events and reports on fiscal guardrails and energy access (Mission300) shaped multilateral narratives [IMF/WorldBank links, e.g.](https://x.com/IMFNews/status/1971312426952905089) and (https://x.com/WorldBank/status/1971651048990265633).\n\nNotable single‚Äëevent paragraphs\n\nThe tariff wave (high significance): The administration‚Äôs announcements of very large, targeted tariffs (notably the 100% pharmaceutical tariff) represent an acute policy shock with immediate distributional, inflationary and trade‚Äëpolicy implications. The measures are broad, industry‚Äëspecific, and set to take effect quickly ‚Äî raising the potential for input price pass‚Äëthrough, corporate reshoring announcements, commodity/retail price jumps, and retaliatory responses from trading partners. The tariffs also change the probability distribution for near‚Äëterm inflation outcomes and complicate the Fed‚Äôs decision calculus. See the tariff summary [here](https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1971360987501482405).\n\nPCE inflation and the Fed debate (high significance): PCE prints this week (headline ~2.7%, core ~2.9%) and a widely publicized divergence of views inside the FOMC (Governor Miran arguing neutral rates are lower and urging faster cuts, others warning of sticky inflation) moved markets and raised uncertainty about the timing and size of rate cuts. This week‚Äôs mix ‚Äî stronger growth metrics, sticky PCE, and intra‚ÄëFed debate ‚Äî is central to near‚Äëterm market dynamics and policy expectations. See the PCE read [here](https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1971553211267096755) and Miran‚Äôs take [here](https://x.com/NickTimiraos/status/1970156734116213055).\n\nGovernment shutdown risk (high significance): Betting markets and reporting showed a materially elevated chance of a shutdown this week (~63‚Äì67%), and the White House instructed agencies to prepare for mass firings if a shutdown happens. That raises near‚Äëterm downside growth and policy‚Äëimplementation risks and is a headline political‚Äëeconomic event this week [shutdown risk](https://x.com/SpencerHakimian/status/1971630586281578534) and [agency prep](https://x.com/unusual_whales/status/1971630094566260749).\n\nBottom line / themes and trends to watch next week:\n- Tariff fallout and pass‚Äëthrough to prices and supply chains (watch CPI/PPI, import prices, and corporate guidance). \n- Fed policy calibration and communications amid sticky PCE and intra‚Äëcommittee division; market pricing for October and beyond. \n- Political risks (shutdown, legal fights over Fed independence) that could amplify market volatility. \n- Elevated market concentration and elevated household equity exposure; risk‚Äëasset fragility if growth or policy expectations shift. \n\nIf you want, I can produce a one‚Äëpage market impact brief showing likely sector winners/losers from the tariff slate, or a short timeline of Fed speakers and economic releases to watch next week."
