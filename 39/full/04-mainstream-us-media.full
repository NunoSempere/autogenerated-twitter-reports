He has also questioned whether pardons and other documents Biden signed using the autopen are valid, even though presidents before Biden used the device to sign key documents. \n\nA House committee is investigating the Biden administration‚Äôs use of the autopen. \n\nThe ‚ÄúPresidential Walk of Fame‚Äù is the Trump administration‚Äôs latest addition to the White House grounds. In the last few months, Trump has paved over the Rose Garden to create a patio and announced plans to construct a ballroom to hold massive banquets.",
