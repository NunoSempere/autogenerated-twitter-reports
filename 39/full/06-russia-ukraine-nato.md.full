Monaco has been shockingly hired as the President of Global Affairs for Microsoft, in a very senior role with access to Highly Sensitive Information. Monaco‚Äôs having that kind of access is unacceptable, and cannot be allowed to stand. She is a menace to U.S. National Security, especially given the major contracts that Microsoft has with the United States Government. Because of Monaco‚Äôs many wrongful acts, the U.S. Government recently stripped her of all Security Clearances, took away all of her access to National Security Intelligence, and banned her from all Federal Properties. It is my opinion that Microsoft should immediately terminate the employment of Lisa Monaco. Thank you for your attention to this matter! President DJT",

However, at the same time, Beijing is using Russia's experience to accelerate its army modernization program and bring its capabilities to the level of the US armed forces.\n\n‚óæÔ∏è The documents, details of which have been verified by the RUSI, a British think tank, appear to demonstrate the deepening alliance between Moscow and Beijing, moving beyond symbolic joint drills and public statements to develop interoperable systems and shared combat experience in areas that China considers critical for winning a battle over Taiwan.\n\n‚óæÔ∏è According to the documents, in October 2024, Russia agreed to sell China 37 BMD-4M light amphibious vehicles, 11 Sprut-SDM1 self-propelled anti-tank guns, 11 BTR-MDM armored personnel carriers, and parachute systems designed to airdrop heavy loads. The total value of the contract was $584 million.\n\n‚óæÔ∏è Separate documents outlined training programs for Chinese paratroopers in the combat use of the weaponry and the advanced command and control systems used to direct operations by Russian specialists in Russia and later in China. RUSI said it would give China's air force \"expanded air maneuver capability\" that offered \"offensive options against Taiwan, the Philippines, and other island states in the regions.\"\n\n‚óæÔ∏è Although Beijing declined to provide military hardware at scale for Russia's war effort, the two countries have continued to celebrate a close security partnership. In 2024, they held 14 joint exercises, nearly double the number a decade earlier.\n\n‚óæÔ∏è Analysts emphasize that for China, Russia's airdrop expertise is most valuable, which is important in the event of an invasion of Taiwan. Chinese planners consider deploying well-equipped units to Taiwan in the early hours of a conflict.\n\n‚óæÔ∏è According to the experts, the Chinese military \"have studied D-Day backward, forward and upside down [and] realized that it would have failed without an airborne component.\" That makes the Russian experience in Ukraine and Syria even more valuable for Beijing.\n\n‚óæÔ∏è If the invasion takes place, Moscow's supply of natural resources and its defense industry could become \"strategic backup for China.\" At the same time, for Taiwan, Russian support for China's airborne capabilities intensifies concerns that Beijing could seize infrastructure inland even as it storms ports and beaches along the coast.\n\nhttps://t.co/GgNMD10JfM",

I thank our warriors for their accuracy. This aircraft, together with others, had been used by Russians to drop aerial bombs on Zaporizhzhia and other Ukrainian cities and villages. We will continue to justly destroy Russian military aviation in response to strikes against our cities and our people. We are also working with our partners to further strengthen our air defense. Following the meetings and agreements in New York these past days, the Ministry of Defense and Ukrainian diplomats have received the relevant instructions.\n\nThe Commander-in-Chief also reported on recent drone incidents along the Ukrainian-Hungarian border. Ukrainian forces recorded violations of our airspace by reconnaissance drones, which are likely Hungarian. Preliminary assessments suggest they may have been conducting reconnaissance on the industrial potential of Ukraine‚Äôs border areas.

      "summarization_question": "Summarize events related to the Russia/Ukraine war and NATO countries' related actions",
      "summary": "Direct answer\nSince late September 2025 the most important Russia/Ukraine war developments and related NATO-country actions are: intensified Ukrainian strikes (especially by drones and unmanned systems) hitting Russian energy and military logistics nodes, growing NATO defensive steps and readiness after repeated airspace incursions, and active diplomatic / weapons debates among Western capitals (including a high-profile U.S. exchange about long‚Äërange Tomahawk strikes). These developments are producing tangible effects inside Russia (fuel shortages, refinery damage) while NATO states expand air policing, test counter‚Äëdrone technologies and consider tougher rules of engagement.\n\nKey themes and topics\n- Drone warfare and counter‚Äëdrone defence: Ukraine is using attack and interceptor drones to strike Russian fuel and logistic targets and to defeat Russian Shahed/FPV strikes; Ukraine is also creating specialized air‚Äëdefense unmanned systems units and reporting interceptor success rates above 70% [see discussion of the new unmanned air‚Äëdefense branch and interceptor performance](https://x.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1971652998553100618). NATO members are responding by testing low‚Äëcost drone countermeasures and accelerating procurement of interceptors and related tech in exercises in Portugal, the Netherlands and elsewhere [Reuters summary of NATO tests](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1971362832924147956).\n- Targeting Russia‚Äôs energy/logistics: Ukrainian strikes have increasingly focused on refineries, fuel hubs and gas distribution points, causing fuel shortages in parts of Russia and disrupting refining capacity (FT/Reuters reporting that 16 of 38 refineries have been hit, disrupting >1 million barrels/day of refining capacity) [source](https://x.com/Mylovanov/status/1971694911981539584). Notable specific attacks include strikes on the Afipsky refinery in Krasnodar [reported here](https://x.com/NOELreports/status/1971600045792174364).\n- NATO airspace incursions and allied responses: Several NATO states reported airspace violations and drone incidents (Denmark temporarily shut airports after drone activity; Lithuania got a Turkish warning plane deployed), and Baltic/Polish allied air policing increased. European diplomats warned Moscow that NATO is prepared to shoot down aircraft that violate allied airspace [Denmark/Reuters](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1971297361923277102) and [Bloomberg summary on the NATO warning](https://x.com/Osinttechnical/status/1971278614588178).\n- Political/diplomatic moves and defence aid debates: High‚Äëlevel diplomacy and meetings (Zelensky‚Äôs U.S. engagements) are ongoing; debates continue over enabling Ukraine to strike deeper into Russia ‚Äî Zelensky asked for Tomahawk cruise missiles and U.S. messaging is mixed, with officials saying restrictions might be eased but no firm commitment yet [reported exchange and followups](https://x.com/NOELreports/status/1971654893573460416). EU sanctions and the idea of using frozen Russian assets to finance Ukraine face internal friction (Hungary as an obstacle) [POLITICO](https://x.com/POLITICOEurope/status/1971643238348951650).\n\nNotable patterns and trends\n- Increased use of low‚Äëcost drones to impose asymmetric effects: Repeated Ukrainian drone campaigns are degrading Russian fuel and repair capacity while also amplifying logistical pain on Russian forces and civilian fuel markets; social reports show gas station closures and rationing in some Russian regions [coverage of closures and refinery hits](https://x.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1971622805163716826).\n- NATO moving from passive monitoring to more active deterrence posture: Greater Baltic/Poland air policing, deployment of partner assets (e.g., Turkey to Lithuania under NATO measures) and public warnings that NATO will respond forcefully to violations signal a harder line and readiness to intercept/shoot down intruders [Reuters on Turkey deployment](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1971312518862668089).\n- Operational innovation in Ukraine: creation of specialized unmanned air‚Äëdefense forces and effective pairing of mechanized systems (e.g., arrival of Patria carriers from Latvia) to counter drone-heavy Russian tactics are recurring operational notes [mechanized capability reporting](https://x.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1971675646850998477).\n- Political friction within the West about the next escalation steps: While many NATO allies push for stronger measures (weapons, sanctions, assets usage), some political actors (e.g., Hungary) and divergent U.S. messaging create friction in implementing unified measures.\n\nImportant mentions, interactions and data points\n- Refinery/energy strike metrics: FT reporting (shared by @Mylovanov) that since August Ukraine struck 16 of 38 Russian refineries, disrupting over 1M barrels/day of refining capacity [source](https://x.com/Mylovanov/status/1971694911981539584). Reuters coverage also highlights the operational and political friction caused by successful strikes [Reuters](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1971532708338692304).\n- Dobropillia counteroffensive: Zelenskyy‚Äôs briefing reported 168.8 km¬≤ liberated and 187.7 km¬≤ cleared of sabotage groups since the operation began, with Russian losses ‚Äò‚Äònearly 3,000‚Äô‚Äô in that operation [Zelenskyy briefing](https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1971560229327327321).\n- Specific facility strike: Afipsky oil refinery in Krasnodar was struck by Ukrainian drone forces overnight (fire reported) [NOELreports](https://x.com/NOELreports/status/1971600045792174364); images and operational claims around multiple gas distribution sites in Luhansk were published by Ukrainian Unmanned Systems [EuromaidanPress](https://x.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1971577509800993144).\n- NATO responses and exercises: NATO testing counter‚Äëdrone tech, conducting increased air policing in the Baltics and launching planning on a European ‚Äúdrone wall‚Äù to protect airspace after incursions [Reuters on NATO tests](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1971362832924147956) and [POLITICO on drone wall plans](https://x.com/POLITICOEurope/status/1971594282126504040).\n- U.S./Tomahawk debate: Zelensky requested Tomahawk cruise missiles in private talks; U.S. officials say restrictions might be eased but no definitive delivery was promised at the time of reporting [NOELreports/WSJ/Axios coverage](https://x.com/NOELreports/status/1971654893573460416).\n\nSignificant events / announcements (each addressed briefly)\n1) Ukrainian strikes on Russian fuel infrastructure and refinery network: Multiple outlets and analysts report a concentrated Ukrainian campaign against refineries and gas distribution nodes that has damaged Russian refining capacity (reportedly 16 of 38 refineries hit, >1M bpd capacity disrupted). The attacks have produced fuel shortages, station closures in parts of Russia and forced Russian logistics/operations adjustments; specific high‚Äëvalue strikes include Afipsky in Krasnodar [see FT/Reuters repost via @Mylovanov](https://x.com/Mylovanov/status/1971694911981539584) and the Afipsky strike report [NOELreports](https://x.com/NOELreports/status/1971600045792174364).\n\n2) NATO airspace incidents, allied responses and counter‚Äëdrone acceleration: Several NATO allies reported incursions or drone incidents (Denmark airports, Baltic airspace, Hungary‚Äëinvolved intercepts). In response NATO allies have ramped up air policing, deployed partner assets (Turkey to Lithuania), publicly warned Moscow that violations may be met with shoot‚Äëdown responses, and accelerated testing and procurement of counter‚ÄëUAV systems and low‚Äëcost interceptors [Denmark/Reuters on airport incidents](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1971297361923277102), [Osinttechnical/Bloomberg on NATO warning](https://x.com/Osinttechnical/status/1971278614588178), and [Reuters on NATO tests](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1971362832924147956).\n\n3) Diplomatic/arms debate over long‚Äërange strikes (Tomahawks) and Western unity: Zelensky‚Äôs outreach to the U.S. raised the question of providing Ukraine with long‚Äërange Tomahawk missiles to strike deeper Russian infrastructure; U.S. messaging was mixed‚Äîreports say restrictions might be eased but no firm commitment was delivered at the time‚Äîhighlighting tension between Ukraine‚Äôs operational requests and allied political calculations [NOELreports/press summaries](https://x.com/NOELreports/status/1971654893573460416).\n\nBottom line\nThe conflict‚Äôs tactical center of gravity is shifting toward high‚Äëvolume drone warfare and targeted strikes on Russian logistics/energy infrastructure; NATO countries are reacting by strengthening air policing, experimenting with and acquiring counter‚Äëdrone systems, and debating tougher political/financial measures. These actions are producing real strategic effects on Russian logistics and domestic economy, while allied political coordination ‚Äî especially on weapons policy and asset‚Äëseizure financing ‚Äî remains contested and consequential."
