      "filter_question": "Is this tweet talking about a development in climate?",
      "summarization_question": "Summarize climate developments last week",
      "summary": "Direct answer\nLast week’s climate developments centered on three connected threads: (1) high-profile diplomacy and new national pledges at UN/Climate Week events, (2) continued extreme-weather events tied to human-driven warming and growing evidence of health and economic harms, and (3) an intensifying political clash over U.S. climate policy and science — with defenders of climate research pushing back against federal rollbacks. Key news also highlighted renewable growth, finance for nature and agriculture, and new analyses showing how warming is already reshaping everyday life.\n\nKey themes and topics\n- International diplomacy and pledges: Multiple reports and briefings from UNFCCC and CarbonBrief noted significant new national commitments after the UN summit: around 100 Parties representing roughly two-thirds of global emissions submitted or unveiled new NDCs [see UNFCCC](https://x.com/UNFCCC/status/1971146057406091320) and CarbonBrief’s analysis that half of global emissions are now covered by 2035 pledges after the summit [see CarbonBrief](https://x.com/CarbonBrief/status/1971549259968221503). China also announced a new Paris-related pledge and became a focus of analysis and webinars by CarbonBrief [see CarbonBrief](https://x.com/CarbonBrief/status/1971548564628160550).\n\n- Extreme weather and attribution: Super Typhoon Ragasa underwent extreme rapid intensification (≈137 kph in ~24 hrs) and was linked to unusually warm ocean waters that were made much more likely by human-caused warming [see ClimateCentral](https://x.com/ClimateCentral/status/1971233683622502557) and related ocean temperature reporting [see ClimateCentral](https://x.com/ClimateCentral/status/1971233688466940345). Europe and other regions also experienced exceptional heat, and tropical systems (Humberto, potential Imelda, Hurricane Gabrielle threatening the Azores/Iberia) were highlighted by trackers and reporters [see ClimateCentral on Humberto/Imelda](https://x.com/ClimateCentral/status/1971615057797882206) and [PGDynes on Gabrielle](https://x.com/PGDynes/status/1971271149146472527).\n\n- Health, generational impacts, and socioeconomic costs: Several pieces drew attention to human impacts — from generational exposure to extreme heat (Climate Central: Gen Z children have experienced ~2x more extremely hot days than millennials and ~4x more than Gen X across 247 U.S. cities) [see ClimateCentral](https://x.com/ClimateCentral/status/1971690706231328979), to maternal and birth risks rising with extreme heat [see ClimateCentral](https://x.com/ClimateCentral/status/1971649808915222812). New research threads also tied EV adoption to reductions in very low birth-weight births (quoted study summary) and estimated enormous lifetime climate costs for Californians born today ($500k–$1M additional costs) [see dwallacewells](https://x.com/dwallacewells/status/1971631139296301389) and [see dwallacewells on EV study](https://x.com/dwallacewells/status/1971664119779807602).\n\n- Energy transition and clean tech momentum vs. policy pushback: Data and reporting showed strong growth in U.S. solar and wind generation (enough to power tens of millions of homes), expanding electric school buses, and continuing declines in coal/gas share for electricity [see ClimateCentral thread](https://x.com/ClimateCentral/status/1970941713305960747). At the same time, U.S. federal rollbacks and political attacks on clean-energy incentives and regulations (and on the EPA endangerment finding) drew criticism from scientists and advocacy groups [see ClimateReality on Endangerment Finding and DOE panel](https://x.com/ClimateReality/status/1971605796057206972) and multiple scientist responses to the President’s UN remarks [see MichaelEMann](https://x.com/MichaelEMann/status/1971573846882070975) and [rahmstorf](https://x.com/rahmstorf/status/1970745593216545027).\n\n- Climate finance, nature, and agriculture: FAO and partners highlighted tools and projects linking adaptation, agrifood systems, and climate finance (new CAR tool, projects in Senegal and Iraq, bioeconomy at G20) [see FAOclimate CAR tool](https://x.com/FAOclimate/status/1971605725148319991) and [FAOclimate Iraq SRVALI](https://x.com/FAOclimate/status/1970906895801266294). CarbonBrief flagged UK aid rising to record levels partly driven by carbon-credit funding and continued analysis of the role of finance and nature-based solutions [see CarbonBrief](https://x.com/CarbonBrief/status/1971653005175816403).\n\nNotable patterns and trends\n- Attribution and rapid intensification: Reports repeatedly connected exceptional storm intensification and unusually warm sea-surface temperatures to human-caused warming (e.g., Ragasa), indicating an ongoing pattern of stronger, faster-developing tropical systems where warm ocean anomalies exist [see ClimateCentral](https://x.com/ClimateCentral/status/1971233683622502557).\n\n- Normalization of overshoot/acceptance debates: Coverage at Climate Week and climate reporting noted a subtle rhetorical shift toward planning for “overshoot” (likely exceeding 1.5°C temporarily), a sign that policymakers and commentators are increasingly preparing for scenarios where 1.5°C is passed before mitigation or removal can bring temperatures down [see insideclimate on Climate Week rhetoric](https://x.com/insideclimate/status/1971234233810387438).\n\n- Increasing linkage between climate and public health/economics: Multiple tweets and articles highlighted growing evidence that climate change is already producing measurable health harms (birth outcomes, maternal health, mental health/brain development) and large economic burdens on current/future generations [see ClimateCentral on maternal health](https://x.com/ClimateCentral/status/1971649808915222812) and [dwallacewells on lifetime costs](https://x.com/dwallacewells/status/1971631139296301389).\n\nImportant mentions, interactions, and data points\n- Generational Warming Tool and findings: Climate Central’s generational analysis across 247 U.S. cities: Gen Z children experienced ~2× more extreme heat days than millennials and ~4× more than Gen X [see ClimateCentral generational tweet](https://x.com/ClimateCentral/status/1971690706231328979) and a tool link [see ClimateCentral tool](https://x.com/ClimateCentral/status/1971690709515489643).\n- City warming examples: Albany, NY warmed ~4.3°F since 1970 [see ClimateCentral](https://x.com/ClimateCentral/status/1971648522593489117); all 30 NFL cities warmed on average 2.8°F during regular season months [see ClimateCentral](https://x.com/ClimateCentral/status/1971291191288439160).\n- Super Typhoon Ragasa rapid intensification: ~137 kph strengthening in ~24 hrs, western Pacific SST anomalies +0.7–1.1°C, event made 10–40× more likely by human-caused warming [see ClimateCentral on Ragasa](https://x.com/ClimateCentral/status/1971233683622502557) and [ocean temps](https://x.com/ClimateCentral/status/1971233688466940345).\n- UN/NDC progress: ~100 Parties (≈2/3 emissions) submitted updated NDCs; CarbonBrief: pledges now cover ~half global emissions to 2035 [see UNFCCC](https://x.com/UNFCCC/status/1971146057406091320) and [CarbonBrief analysis](https://x.com/CarbonBrief/status/1971549259968221503).\n- Policy/administration conflict: Scientific community and advocacy groups mobilized against administration rollbacks and misinformation (NASEM assessment cited to defend the Endangerment Finding; multiple scientists rebutted the President’s UN statements) [see ClimateReality NASEM tweet](https://x.com/ClimateReality/status/1971605796057206972) and [MichaelEMann op-ed/tweet](https://x.com/MichaelEMann/status/1971573846882070975).\n\nSignificant events or announcements (each highlighted)\n1) UN/Climate Week outcomes and pledges: Climate Week/UNGA activity drove numerous national announcements and a wave of reporting about NDC updates. The UNFCCC reported ~100 Parties (covering ~2/3 of emissions) submitted or unveiled new climate plans; CarbonBrief’s follow-up analysis said new 2035 pledges now cover roughly half of global emissions — a meaningful step for COP30 prep, though analysts caution that many pledges still fall short of 1.5°C pathways [see UNFCCC](https://x.com/UNFCCC/status/1971146057406091320) and [CarbonBrief](https://x.com/CarbonBrief/status/1971549259968221503).\n\n2) Super Typhoon Ragasa and extreme storm attribution: Ragasa’s extreme rapid intensification and records as one of the year’s strongest tropical systems was explicitly linked to unusually warm sea-surface temperatures that were many times more likely because of human-driven warming; that event reinforced the week’s broader theme that storms and heat extremes are increasingly intensified by background warming [see ClimateCentral on Ragasa](https://x.com/ClimateCentral/status/1971233683622502557) and [ocean temp thread](https://x.com/ClimateCentral/status/1971233688466940345).\n\n3) U.S. political clashes over climate science and protections: The week featured public confrontation between the U.S. administration’s climate messaging and the scientific community. The President’s UN remarks denying mainstream climate warnings prompted multiple scientist rebuttals, while groups celebrated a legal/scientific pushback (NASEM assessment) that complicates efforts to rescind the EPA Endangerment Finding — a key piece in the administration’s regulatory agenda [see MichaelEMann](https://x.com/MichaelEMann/status/1971573846882070975) and [ClimateReality on NASEM](https://x.com/ClimateReality/status/1971605796057206972).\n\nBottom line\nLast week combined diplomatic momentum (new pledges and COP30 preparation) with stark reminders that warming is already changing weather, health, and economies now. Scientific attribution of extreme storms and extensive reporting on health and generational harms strengthened the evidence base; at the same time, political fights over U.S. climate policy and regulatory rollbacks intensified, making the policy outlook uneven even as international commitments and clean-energy deployment continue to advance."
