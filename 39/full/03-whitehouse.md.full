Monaco has been shockingly hired as the President of Global Affairs for Microsoft, in a very senior role with access to Highly Sensitive Information. Monaco's having that kind of access is unacceptable, and cannot be allowed to stand. She is a menace to U.S. National Security, especially given the major contracts that Microsoft has with the United States Government. Because of Monaco's many wrongful acts, the U.S. Government recently stripped her of all Security Clearances, took away all of her access to National Security Intelligence, and banned her from all Federal Properties. It is my opinion that Microsoft should immediately terminate the employment of Lisa Monaco. Thank you for your attention to this matter! President DJT",

It was only that we were each holding the handrail tightly or, it would have been a disaster. This was absolutely sabotage, as noted by a day's earlier \"post\" in The London Times that said UN workers \"joked about turning off an escalator.\" The people that did it should be arrested! Then, as I stood before a Television crowd of millions of people all over the World, and important Leaders in the Hall, my teleprompter didn't work. It was stone cold dark. I immediately thought to myself, \"Wow, first the escalator event, and now a bad teleprompter. What kind of a place is this?\" I then proceeded to make a Speech without a teleprompter, which kicked in about 15 minutes later. The good news is the Speech has gotten fantastic reviews. Maybe they appreciated the fact that very few people could have done what I did. And third, after making the Speech, I was told that the sound was completely off in the Auditorium where the Speech was made, that World Leaders, unless they used the interpreters' earpieces, couldn't hear a thing. The first person I saw at the conclusion of the Speech was Melania, who was sitting right up front. I said, \"How did I do?\" And she said, \"I couldn't hear a word you said.\" This wasn't a coincidence, this was triple sabotage at the UN. They ought to be ashamed of themselves. I'm sending a copy of this letter to the Secretary General, and I demand an immediate investigation. No wonder the United Nations hasn't been able to do the job that they were put in existence to do. All security tapes at the escalator should be saved, especially the emergency stop button. The Secret Service is involved. Thank you for your attention to this matter!",

With time, patience, and the financial support of Europe and, in particular, NATO, the original Borders from where this War started, is very much an option. Why not? Russia has been fighting aimlessly for three and a half years a War that should have taken a Real Military Power less than a week to win. This is not distinguishing Russia. In fact, it is very much making them look like \"a paper tiger.\" When the people living in Moscow, and all of the Great Cities, Towns, and Districts all throughout Russia, find out what is really going on with this War, the fact that it's almost impossible for them to get Gasoline through the long lines that are being formed, and all of the other things that are taking place in their War Economy, where most of their money is being spent on fighting Ukraine, which has Great Spirit, and only getting better, Ukraine would be able to take back their Country in its original form and, who knows, maybe even go further than that! Putin and Russia are in BIG Economic trouble, and this is the time for Ukraine to act. In any event, I wish both Countries well. We will continue to supply weapons to NATO for NATO to do what they want with them. Good luck to all! \n\nDONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA",

I have been talking about this for a long period of time and this Forum, was the absolute best from the standpoint of making these two important statements. I hope everybody gets to watch it! The teleprompter was broken and the escalator came to a sudden hault as we were ridding up to the podium, but both of those events probably made the speech more interesting than it would have been otherwise. It is always an honor to speak at the United Nations, even if, their equipment is somewhat faulty. Make America Great Again!",

They are threatening to shut down the Government of the United States unless they can have over $1 Trillion Dollars in new spending to continue free healthcare for Illegal Aliens (A monumental cost!), force Taxpayers to fund Transgender surgery for minors, have dead people on the Medicaid roles, allow Illegal Alien Criminals to steal Billions of Dollars in American Taxpayer Benefits, try to force our Country to again open our Borders to Criminals and to the World, allow men to play in women's sports, and essentially create Transgender operations for everybody. These Radical Left Views and Policies is what allowed me to win the Presidential Election, including all seven Swing States, and the Popular Vote, IN A HISTORIC LANDSLIDE. There are consequences to losing Elections but, based on their letter to me, the Democrats haven't figured that out yet. They are trying to eliminate the popular $50 Billion Dollar Rural and Vulnerable Hospital Fund, which was passed with only Republican Votes, and proudly signed into Law by ME. The Democrats in Congress seem to have totally lost their way. They obviously have no idea what it means to put America First or to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! All Congressional Democrats want to do is enact Radical Left Policies that nobody voted for — High Taxes, Open Borders, No Consequences for Violent Criminals, Men in Women's Sports, Taxpayer funded \"TRANSGENDER\" surgery, and much more. Few people voted for what they represent, which would lead to the destruction of America. Instead, people voted for COMMON SENSE, and that's what the Republicans and your President, \"DONALD J. TRUMP,\" stand for. I look forward to meeting with them if they get serious about the future of our Nation. We must keep the Government open, and legislate like true Patriots rather than hold American Citizens hostage, knowing that they want our now thriving Country closed. I'll be happy to meet with them if they agree to the Principles in this Letter. They must do their job! Otherwise, it will just be another long and brutal slog through their radicalized quicksand. To the Leaders of the Democrat Party, the ball is in your court. I look forward to meeting with you when you become realistic about the things that our Country stands for. DO THE RIGHT THING!\n\nDONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA",

Antifa as a Terrorist Threat.  Antifa is amilitarist, anarchist enterprise that explicitly calls for the overthrow of the United States Government, law enforcement authorities, and our system of law.  It uses illegal means to organize and execute a campaign of violence and terrorism nationwide to accomplish these goals.  This campaign involves coordinated efforts to obstruct enforcement of Federal laws through armed standoffs with law enforcement, organized riots, violent assaults on Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other law enforcement officers, and routine doxing of and other threats against political figures and activists. Antifa recruits, trains, and radicalizes young Americans to engage in this violence and suppression of political activity, then employs elaborate means and mechanisms to shield the identities of its operatives, conceal its funding sources and operations in an effort to frustrate law enforcement, and recruit additional members.  Individuals associated with and acting on behalf of Antifa further coordinate with other organizations and entities for the purpose of spreading, fomenting, and advancing political violence and suppressing lawful political speech.  This organized effort designed to achieve policy objectives by coercion and intimidation is domestic terrorism.\n\n​Sec. 2. Designation as a Domestic Terrorist Organization.  Because of the aforementioned pattern of political violence designed to suppress lawful political activity and obstruct the rule of law, I hereby designate Antifa as a \"domestic terrorist organization.\"  All relevant executive departments and agencies shall utilize all applicable authorities to investigate, disrupt, and dismantle any and all illegal operations --especially those involving terrorist actions -- conducted by Antifa or any person claiming to act on behalf of Antifa, or for which Antifa or any person claiming to act on behalf of Antifa provided material support, including necessary investigatory and prosecutorial actions against those who fund such operations.\n\nSec. 3. General Provisions.  (a)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law.  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n\n(b)  This order shall be published in the Federal Register.\n\nDONALD J. TRUMP\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\nSeptember 22, 2025.",

See the White House warning about an expiring health program if Senate Democrats block funding [Press Secretary tweet](https://x.com/PressSec/status/1971683969877119033) and the White House framing of the funding fight as a Democratic shutdown threat [WhiteHouse tweet](https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1971684190761762903).\n\nKey themes and topics this week:\n- Funding and shutdown risk: The administration is aggressively pushing a clean, short-term continuing resolution and warning that a shutdown would end or interrupt programs (notably WIC and a home-care program for low-income/Medicare patients). The White House repeatedly blames Senate Democrats for risking benefit expirations and economic harm if funding lapses (examples: warnings about WIC and travel-sector losses; see a WH warning on an expiring health program: https://x.com/PressSec/status/1971683969877119033 and related RapidResponse post https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1971683761201782884).\n- Foreign policy and U.N.: President Trump and senior officials are centered at the U.N. General Assembly, delivering a blunt anti-globalism message, touting peacemaking claims, and holding bilateral meetings (e.g., with Turkey’s Erdogan, Ukraine’s Zelenskyy, Argentina’s Milei, and UN Secretary-General Guterres). The administration is using UNGA appearances to press energy/trade and security themes and to promote U.S. leadership (see the White House coverage of the UN remarks and bilateral meetings: https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1970490427900846580 and https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1971242187284512875).\n- Domestic security and law enforcement: Major executive steps and public rhetoric this week emphasize law-and-order. The administration has (a) designated Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization and announced a cross-government strategy to investigate and dismantle ‘‘left‑wing’’ organized political violence (see PressSec announcement https://x.com/PressSec/status/1970484025136685530 and the full order text repost https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1970250137193644374), and (b) directed DOJ action on capital punishment in D.C. and other aggressive enforcement steps.\n- Tech/national-security interventions: The White House announced an executive action / deal it says ‘‘saves TikTok’’ under U.S. control and protects data — a centerpiece of the week’s national-security + tech messaging (see the White House breaking post on the TikTok action: https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1971312721573576815).\n- Trade and tariffs: The administration continues a high-profile protectionist trade push — raising or threatening large tariffs on pharmaceuticals, heavy trucks, furniture, and other goods, and touting related manufacturing investments (examples: tariff announcements and company responses are repeatedly posted; see a tariff-related WH post: https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1971355989711651294 and Eli Lilly investment coverage https://x.com/PressSec/status/1970848766774370466).\n- Health, family, and education initiatives: The White House rolled out an ‘‘Autism Action Plan’’ and FDA guidance flagging a potential acetaminophen-in-pregnancy risk and announced distribution of new federal attention to autism research and physician advisories (see the White House autism/medical announcement: https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1970238866394099891 and the FDA/physician guidance post: https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1970268144569819420). The First Lady launched a global fostering/child welfare coalition (Fostering the Future Together) and Education Dept. made a major charter funding announcement.\n\nNotable patterns and trends:\n- Messaging repetition and partisan framing: Nearly every White House account and allied rapid-response channels frame the week’s items through a two-part lens: (1) Democrats are handing the American people possible harm (shutdown, benefit losses, funding for immigrants) and (2) the administration is taking decisive unilateral actions to protect Americans (tariffs, designating Antifa, law-and-order steps, border enforcement). Several tweets cycle the same claims across accounts to keep pressure on Congress.\n- Executive action over Congress: There is a clear pattern of the administration using executive orders/ proclamations (Antifa designation; TikTok deal; autism/FDA guidance; death-penalty enforcement in D.C.; trade directives) to move policy quickly rather than relying on new legislation.\n- Convergent foreign/domestic posture: The U.N. appearances and bilateral meetings are being used to bolster narratives about U.S. strength, energy dominance, and security while domestic announcements stress border control and national-security enforcement — presenting a unified ‘‘strong on security and sovereignty’’ theme.\n\nImportant data points, interactions, and specific mentions:\n- Shutdown/funding: The Press Secretary warned that a program enabling home treatment of low-income/Medicare patients will expire if Democrats block a short-term funding plan [https://x.com/PressSec/status/1971683969877119033]. White House channels press that a clean short-term funding bill was passed by House Republicans and urge Senate action.\n- WIC and travel economy: WH posts cite warnings that WIC benefits and travel-sector losses (cited as ~$1B/week) would follow a shutdown; these figures are used to pressure Senators (examples: https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1971655976718832092 and https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1971656919858532352).\n- UN diplomacy: President’s UN speech and a series of meetings (Erdogan, Zelenskyy, Milei, Guterres) are prominent; WH is amplifying ‘‘peace’’ and U.S. leadership themes (see speech and bilateral meeting posts https://x.com/PressSec/status/1970541954082512982 and https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1971242187284512875).\n- Antifa/domestic terrorism: The administration announced an order designating Antifa a domestic terrorist organization and set out to mobilize agencies to investigate and dismantle associated threats (order text and PR: https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1970250137193644374 and https://x.com/PressSec/status/1970484025136685530).\n- TikTok: The White House claims to have ‘‘saved TikTok’’ via an executive order/deal to secure American control and data protections (https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1971312721573576815).\n- Autism/FDA: Administration launched an Autism Action Plan and FDA guidance about acetaminophen in pregnancy; the White House positions this as a major child-health initiative (https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1970238866394099891 and https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1970268144569819420).\n- Tariffs and industrial policy: Multiple posts announce or threaten steep tariffs (including on pharmaceuticals) and highlight investment responses (Eli Lilly $6.5B Texas facility cited by WH) as intended outcomes (https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1971355989711651294 and https://x.com/PressSec/status/1970848766774370466).\n- ICE shooting and law-enforcement rhetoric: The administration is responding strongly to a shooting at a Dallas ICE field office, condemning anti-ICE rhetoric and calling for calmer public language from Democrats and local officials (see WH statement and DHS calls for condemnations: https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1970952551144313218 and https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1971678074505757134).\n\nSignificant events / announcements (each in one paragraph):\n\n1) Funding fight and shutdown warnings — the White House is spending major political capital this week to force a vote on a short-term funding measure, repeatedly warning that a shutdown would immediately threaten benefits (WIC, home-care programs for low-income and Medicare patients), harm the travel economy, and disrupt operations. The admin frames House Republicans as having passed a ‘‘clean’’ CR and blames Senate Democrats for threatening the shutdown; this is central to daily WH messaging and outreach to swing senators (example: WH/PressSec warnings on expiring health programs and shutdown risk: https://x.com/PressSec/status/1971683969877119033).\n\n2) U.N. General Assembly diplomacy and bilateral meetings — the President used U.N. appearances this week to deliver a forceful anti-globalism, pro‑sovereignty speech, and to hold a series of bilateral meetings (Turkey, Ukraine, Argentina, UN Secretary-General). The White House is amplifying claims of peacemaking progress and U.S. strength while using those forums to press energy and trade agendas (see President’s UN remarks and bilateral meeting posts: https://x.com/PressSec/status/1970541954082512982 and https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1970490427900846580).\n\n3) Major executive actions on domestic security and tech — the administration issued an order designating Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization and announced a broad strategy to investigate and dismantle organized political violence; at the same time the White House announced an executive action/deal to keep TikTok operating under U.S. control and protect user data. Both actions highlight the week’s preference for unilateral executive tools to address perceived threats (Antifa order and text: https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1970250137193644374; TikTok action: https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1971312721573576815).\n\n4) Health and family policy moves — the White House launched an Autism Action Plan and prompted FDA advisory guidance on acetaminophen use during pregnancy, pitching this as a major public-health priority for children and families; FLOTUS also launched a global child welfare/ fostering coalition (see autism announcement and FDA notice: https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1970238866394099891 and https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1970268144569819420; FLOTUS coalition: https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1970554770797498775).\n\n5) Trade, tariffs and industrial policy — the administration continued to announce aggressive tariff plans (pharmaceuticals, furniture, heavy trucks) and promote industrial investment as a direct outcome of protectionist measures; the WH highlights revised GDP and consumer-spending strength while using tariffs to justify reshoring and new plant commitments (tariff pronouncements and industry responses: https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1971355989711651294 and https://x.com/PressSec/status/1970848766774370466).\n\nBottom line: The White House this week is simultaneously in crisis‑management mode on a potential shutdown, on a global stage with U.N. diplomacy and leader meetings, and executing a high‑velocity slate of executive actions (domestic terrorism designation, TikTok deal, autism/FDA steps, tariff pronouncements). Messaging is tightly coordinated across WH accounts to pressure Congress, emphasize law-and-order and border security, and promote trade/economic wins.
