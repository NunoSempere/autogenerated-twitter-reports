Direct answer
Last week’s notable cyberattack news centered on: a widespread supply-chain compromise in the JavaScript ecosystem by a self‑replicating worm called Shai‑Hulud; a cloud backup compromise affecting MySonicWall driven by brute‑force access; addition of a Chrome V8 type‑confusion vulnerability (CVE‑2025‑10585) to CISA’s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog; CISA-led incident response and published lessons after malicious activity at a U.S. federal agency; and ongoing emphasis on community resilience exercises. Key public posts and alerts were shared by @CISAgov and allied CISA accounts highlighting these developments (see linked posts below).

Key themes and topics
- Supply‑chain and software‑repository risk: the Shai‑Hulud worm that compromised hundreds of JavaScript packages underscores ongoing risks in package registries and the potential for rapid, automated propagation. (See report shared by CISA/CISA Cyber: https://x.com/CISAgov/status/1970825700358881444)
- Credential/authorization weaknesses and cloud backups: the MySonicWall incident involved brute‑force access to cloud backup files, highlighting weak authentication/password‑management and exposed backup stores as high‑value targets (https://x.com/CISAgov/status/1970228819211473154).
- Vulnerability tracking and prioritization: CISA added Google Chrome V8 type‑confusion vulnerability CVE‑2025‑10585 to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, signaling active exploitation or urgent risk and prompting rapid patching and mitigation actions (https://x.com/CISAgov/status/1970564120538947906).
- Incident response, transparency, and learning: CISA described launching response efforts after a federal agency detected malicious activity and published lessons/mitigations — emphasizing rapid response, interagency coordination, and sharing of defensive guidance (https://x.com/CISAgov/status/1970494370735353861).
- Community preparedness and resilience: CISA participated in a local Community Resilience Analysis Tabletop Exercise with Minot, ND and Ward County Emergency Management to assess combined physical and cyber response and short‑term recovery (https://x.com/CISAgov/status/1971596067582926986).

Notable patterns and trends
- Increasing focus on supply‑chain integrity: automated worms and compromised packages continue to threaten open‑source ecosystems, amplifying impact across many downstream projects. The Shai‑Hulud event fits a growing pattern of package registry abuse.
- Attackers exploiting weak access controls and automated credential attacks: brute‑force compromises of cloud services/backups remain a recurring vector (MySonicWall incident).
- Faster operationalization of vulnerability intelligence: CISA’s quick addition of CVE‑2025‑10585 to the KEV catalog shows an emphasis on rapidly prioritizing and communicating vulnerabilities that are known or likely to be exploited.
- Emphasis on post‑incident sharing: CISA is leaning on public alerts, catalogs, and published lessons to accelerate defender response and patching across affected communities.

Important mentions, interactions, and data points
- Shai‑Hulud reportedly compromised over 500 packages in the JavaScript registry (reported via CISA/CISA Cyber repost) — a large-scale, supply‑chain impact (https://x.com/CISAgov/status/1970825700358881444).
- CVE‑2025‑10585 (Google Chrome V8 type confusion) was added to CISA’s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog; inclusion typically signals active exploitation or severe risk requiring immediate mitigation (https://x.com/CISAgov/status/1970564120538947906).
- MySonicWall cloud backup incident involved a malicious actor using brute‑force to gain access to backup files — incident led to a CISA alert with recommended mitigations (https://x.com/CISAgov/status/1970228819211473154).
- CISA launched incident response after malicious activity at a U.S. federal agency and published lessons learned and mitigations — an important example of federal-level detection, response, and public guidance (https://x.com/CISAgov/status/1970494370735353861).
- CISA engaged with local partners in a Community Resilience Analysis Tabletop Exercise examining combined physical and cyber impacts and short‑term recovery (https://x.com/CISAgov/status/1971596067582926986).

Significant events (each summarized)
- Shai‑Hulud worm compromising JavaScript packages: A self‑replicating worm known as Shai‑Hulud compromised more than 500 packages in the world’s largest JavaScript registry, demonstrating how quickly supply‑chain malware can spread and contaminate many downstream projects. This event heightens urgency for package‑security measures (signing, provenance, stricter publishing controls) and for maintainers to audit dependencies (https://x.com/CISAgov/status/1970825700358881444).

- MySonicWall cloud backup file incident: CISA/CISA Cyber released an alert after a malicious actor used brute‑force techniques to access MySonicWall cloud backup files. The incident highlights the need for robust password policies, multi‑factor authentication, monitoring for unauthorized access, and secure handling of backups; CISA provided mitigations and guidance (https://x.com/CISAgov/status/1970228819211473154).

- CVE‑2025‑10585 added to CISA’s KEV catalog (Chrome V8): CISA added a Google Chrome V8 type‑confusion vulnerability (CVE‑2025‑10585) to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog. Inclusion signals active or imminent exploitation and typically prompts emergency patching and mitigation priorities for organizations using affected Chrome versions (https://x.com/CISAgov/status/1970564120538947906).

- CISA incident response & published lessons after federal agency detection: After a U.S. federal agency detected malicious activity, CISA launched incident response efforts, documented lessons learned, and published mitigations. This public sharing demonstrates federal emphasis on rapid containment, interagency coordination, and post‑incident learning to help other organizations defend against similar threats (https://x.com/CISAgov/status/1970494370735353861).

Other notable activity
- Community resilience tabletop exercise in Minot, ND: CISA participated in and thanked local partners for hosting a Community Resilience Analysis Tabletop Exercise to assess joint response plans and short‑term recovery for incidents with both physical and cyber impacts — signaling continued investment in local preparedness and whole‑community coordination (https://x.com/CISAgov/status/1971596067582926986).

Bottom line
Last week reinforced three practical takeaways: 1) protect the software supply chain and monitor dependencies for malicious changes; 2) harden authentication and backup access to prevent brute‑force and credential‑based intrusions; and 3) promptly apply patches/mitigations for vulnerabilities flagged as actively exploited (as reflected by CISA KEV listings), while leveraging shared incident‑response lessons and local preparedness exercises to improve resilience.
