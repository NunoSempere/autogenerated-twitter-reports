Hassett probably is familiar with this because those first four nominees were made when Hassett was the CEA chair. Only one governor in this time period (Brainard) was an Obama appointee.\n\nThe Fed of course raised rates aggressively once it became clear how offsides it was. Biden appointees began to fill up the board in Q2 2022 (Cook and Jefferson joined right before the first 75 bps hike in June 2022, and Barr joined them in voting for the next 3 hikes of 75 bps each in July 2022).",

      "summarization_question": "What are the key economics events this week?",
      "summary": "Direct answer — top economics events this week\n\n1) U.S. government shutdown and its economic fallout — dominant story\n- The partial federal shutdown (continuing past Oct 1) is the week’s biggest macro event: Congress failed to pass stopgap funding, the House won’t be recalled next week and the shutdown is expected to last days-to-weeks (estimates vary: prediction markets ~2 weeks; some models put a 10–29 day range). See reporting on the House schedule and shutdown projections (Mike Johnson won’t call the House) (https://x.com/SpencerHakimian/status/1974201918424850555) and a Polymarket projection cited here (https://x.com/unusual_whales/status/1973893760116261112).\n- Immediate consequences: the Bureau of Labor Statistics paused collection/publication of key economic data (no BLS jobs report while the shutdown continues) (https://x.com/unusual_whales/status/1974087312880656509; https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1973972025770455549). Treasury-option markets and strategists show the shutdown is already affecting pricing and investor expectations (https://x.com/business/status/1974157535427919968). The White House is furloughing staff and weighing large personnel and agency cuts; funds for some projects (e.g., $2.1bn in Chicago) have been paused (https://x.com/unusual_whales/status/1974186942259745016; https://x.com/WSJ/status/1974127198404489257).\n- Why it matters: With labor and other monthly data delayed, investors and the Fed will have to make near-term decisions with gaps in official information — increasing uncertainty around the timing and size of Fed moves and near-term market volatility.\n\n2) Monetary policy and market rate expectations\n- Market pricing and strategist views moved toward earlier rate cuts: Citi strategists see two 25bp Fed cuts (October and December) priced in; this expectation influenced risk asset rallies (https://x.com/unusual_whales/status/1974232492380205422; https://x.com/business/status/1974183235321049110). Treasury yields fell and markets traded the prospect of easier policy even as several Fed officials urged caution (comments from Bank of Dallas Lorie Logan and Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson emphasize the need for gradualism) (https://x.com/business/status/1974181233031536871; https://x.com/business/status/1974168614467948567). Treasuries experienced significant moves as shutdown-driven uncertainty and Fed signaling interacted (https://x.com/business/status/1974142692826231036).\n- Fed-watch complication: missing BLS jobs data removes a key input before the next Fed meeting, complicating the policy outlook and increasing the weight on other (imperfect) indicators (https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1973972025770455549).\n\n3) Markets: equity records, risk-on flows, and asset rotations\n- U.S. equities hit intraday/all-time highs across major indices (S&P 500, Nasdaq, Dow, Russell) even as the shutdown and mixed economic indicators persisted — risk-on positioning has been strong (https://x.com/unusual_whales/status/1974179896118125015; https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1974107472836362448).\n- Drivers and tensions: a potent mix of AI optimism and expected Fed easing is fueling the rally, while veteran investors voice bubble warnings (Jeff Bezos and Goldman/Goldman strategists caution about froth in AI spending) (https://x.com/business/status/1974097176046305378; https://x.com/unusual_whales/status/1974176875917553906; https://x.com/business/status/1974139921536360568).\n- Participation and positioning: retail investors and options activity surged — call options volumes hit record averages, retail net buying of equities persisted, and institutional selling occurred alongside retail buying (options & flow data: https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1974166054965260476; retail buying: https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1973870356114088441).\n\n4) Safe havens and commodities: gold, silver, bitcoin, oil\n- Precious metals and crypto: gold extended a long run of gains (eight consecutive quarters noted), rose sharply YTD, and neared new records; silver climbed to 14-year highs; bitcoin rallied toward its all-time high amid the risk-on move and shutdown uncertainty (https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1974142147117895949; https://x.com/Barchart/status/1974140291226485072; https://x.com/CNBC/status/1974158796827078903). These moves reflect a mix of inflation/monetary expectations and safe‑haven/portfolio hedging.\n- Oil & energy: OPEC+ discussions and shifting supply signals (and a mixed forward curve) were in focus ahead of OPEC meetings; meanwhile U.S. crude production hit a record ~13.6m bpd in July, reinforcing supply-side narratives (https://x.com/business/status/1974139075197022687; https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1974184677524009067).\n\n5) Big deals, M&A and sector-specific moves (data centers, AI, gaming)\n- Large data‑center deals and M&A dominated corporate headlines: Global Infrastructure Partners/BlackRock’s GIP was reported in advanced talks to buy Aligned Data Centers in a potential ~$40bn deal (one of the largest for a data‑center company) (https://x.com/business/status/1974217954754548031; https://x.com/business/status/1973945586165366947). BlackRock/AI-capex themes and big-ticket bids highlight private capital chasing infrastructure exposed to AI demand.\n- Other notable corporate developments: Electronic Arts agreed to a large takeover (feature in The Economist coverage) and Cerebras withdrew its IPO filing; Coinbase is seeking a national trust charter — all part of an active corporate/tech story this week (https://x.com/TheEconomist/status/1974165091651133651; https://x.com/business/status/1974230515013075285; https://x.com/business/status/1974228200029856002).\n\n6) Labor market softness, services weakness, and layoffs\n- Mixed/softer signals: ISM services and private filings suggest cooling demand in services and ongoing strain in the labor market — some measures at or near the expansion/contraction boundary (ISM/services ~50) with subcomponents weak (https://x.com/SpencerHakimian/status/1974112305064652993; https://x.com/elerianm/status/1974115660809523523).\n- Layoffs and credit stress: job-cut announcements and layoffs remain elevated year‑to‑date (hundreds of thousands), and certain consumer-credit niches (subprime auto) are showing stress (https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1974201035037229329; https://x.com/unusual_whales/status/1973938807079641253).\n\n7) Policy changes, trade/tariffs, visas and litigation\n- Immigration & labor supply policy: the Trump administration’s plan to raise an H-1B fee to $100,000 prompted lawsuits from staffing agencies and unions (https://x.com/WSJ/status/1974232856957174145; https://x.com/business/status/1974203828028244469).\n- Tariff-driven stimulus proposals: the administration is publicly considering redistributing tariff revenue as rebate checks — a political/economic story that markets and commentators have debated (https://x.com/unusual_whales/status/1973945601483014353).\n\n8) International and emerging market developments\n- China/US investment relations: China is reported to be pressing to roll back U.S. curbs on Chinese deals (negotiation/tactical leverage via investment incentives) (https://x.com/unusual_whales/status/1974240797387022780; https://x.com/business/status/1974136139402387732).\n- Argentina and IMF/US involvement: the IMF and U.S. officials signaled support for Argentina amid policy turmoil around President Javier Milei, and Argentine bonds experienced extreme volatility (https://x.com/business/status/1974231257132229008; https://x.com/business/status/1974141559021903930).\n- Record foreign demand for U.S. equities: foreign holdings of U.S. equities rose to an historic ~$20tn (about 30% of the U.S. equity market), underscoring global investors’ heavy exposure to U.S. risk assets (https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1974228717489762325).\n\nNotable patterns and cross-cutting trends\n- Market/real-economy divergence: a strong equity rally (AI-led) coincided with clear signs of economic softness (hiring weakness, services teetering, rising layoffs and delayed official data). That divergence is a central risk theme: exuberant positioning vs. incomplete/shaky macro data.\n- Elevated risk-on positioning with structural hedging: record options/call activity and large retail net purchases sit alongside big flows into safe-haven metals (gold/silver) and crypto — investors are both chasing upside and hedging uncertainty.\n- Concentration of capital in AI & infrastructure: data‑center M&A, big AI capex estimates, and the tech‑led rally reflect a concentration of capital into asset classes tied to AI deployment, even as veteran investors warn of a bubble.\n\nHighly significant single-developments (each one-paragraph):\n- Government shutdown and suspended economic data: The shutdown’s immediate economic impact is twofold — operational (furloughs, project holds, lawsuits and agency cuts) and informational (suspension of BLS data releases and other federal statistics). That information gap matters materially because markets and the Fed will make near-term decisions (and price risk) with fewer official datapoints; strategists and prediction markets are already pricing in an extended shutdown and related market effects (https://x.com/unusual_whales/status/1974087312880656509; https://x.com/SpencerHakimian/status/1974201918424850555; https://x.com/business/status/1974157535427919968).\n\n- Market/monetary pivot priced in despite mixed fundamentals: Citi and other strategists see the Fed cutting rates (25bp moves expected in Oct and Dec by some market participants), and risk assets have rallied to fresh highs on that expectation. That combination — early easing priced in while underlying labor and services data show weakness — creates a fragile policy/market dynamic that amplifies the risk of a sharp repricing if incoming data (once published) differ meaningfully (https://x.com/unusual_whales/status/1974232492380205422; https://x.com/business/status/1974183235321049110).\n\nImportant mentions and quick data points (high-salience bullets)\n- BLS jobs report: suspended during shutdown, removing a key Fed-input (https://x.com/unusual_whales/status/1974087312880656509).  \n- Foreign holdings of U.S. equities: record ~$20 trillion (≈30% of US equity market) (https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1974228717489762325).  \n- U.S. crude production: record ~13.6m b/d in July (https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1974184677524009067).  \n- Gold: 8 consecutive quarterly gains and a large YTD rally, approaching $4,000/oz (https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1974142147117895949).  \n- Options & calls: average daily call volume >40m contracts over 20 days (record activity) (https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1974166054965260476).  \n- Data-center M&A: Aligned Data Centers deal talks near $40bn (https://x.com/business/status/1974217954754548031).\n\nBottom-line takeaway\nThis week’s economics narrative is anchored by a politically-driven U.S. government shutdown that has already disrupted data flows and federal programs — creating policy and informational uncertainty at the worst possible time for markets. That uncertainty is colliding with a market environment dominated by AI optimism and expectations of Fed easing (some strategists price cuts as soon as Oct/Dec), producing a sharp divergence between equity markets (at records) and a still-fragile real economy (softening services, elevated layoffs, suspended jobs data). Investors are responding with heavy positioning (options/retail buying) while rotating into commodities and infrastructure plays (gold, data centers, energy), leaving the coming weeks highly sensitive to (1) the shutdown’s duration and data-gap impact and (2) whether incoming (or delayed) economic releases confirm or contradict the upbeat market narrative.\n\nKey tweet sources (representative):\n- Shutdown / House schedule: https://x.com/SpencerHakimian/status/1974201918424850555\n- BLS/data suspension: https://x.com/unusual_whales/status/1974087312880656509\n- Fed cuts priced (Citi): https://x.com/unusual_whales/status/1974232492380205422\n- Treasury options/shutdown pricing: https://x.com/business/status/1974157535427919968\n- Equity records and market flows: https://x.com/unusual_whales/status/1974179896118125015; https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1974107472836362448\n- Gold trend: https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1974142147117895949\n- Data center M&A (Aligned / GIP): https://x.com/business/status/1974217954754548031\n- China / U.S. deal rollback diplomacy: https://x.com/unusual_whales/status/1974240797387022780\n- H-1B fee legal challenge: https://x.com/WSJ/status/1974232856957174145\n\n"
