Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries, and the other Minority Radical Left Democrats tried their best, through the ridiculous Government Shutdown, to destroy this wonderful celebration of the U.S. Navy’s Birthday, and to stop our Military Servicemembers from celebrating American Naval History. However, I believe, “THE SHOW MUST GO ON!” The U.S. Navy has been planning this event for many months and, despite the Democrats’ incompetence, I refuse to let them down as their Commander-in-Chief. This will be the largest Celebration in the History of the Navy.

As retribution for the October 7th attack on civilization, more than 25,000 Hamas “soldiers” have already been killed.

Fuel supply disruptions caused the number of gas stations selling gasoline to drop by 360 locations (roughly every 50th station). Long lines of cars stretching for kilometers have formed at the stations that remained open.\n\nThe fuel crisis has affected residents in more than 20 regions of Russia, including Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories.\n\n🗺 Geography of the collapse\n\nAt the end of August, a gasoline shortage was reported in Zabaykalsky Krai, Primorye, the Kuril Islands, and occupied Crimea. On the peninsula, amid the gasoline shortage, gas station owners have been selling counterfeit fuel.\n\nIn September, the shortage spread to Ryazan, Nizhny Novgorod, Saratov, Samara, Ulyanovsk, Penza, Rostov, Astrakhan, Mordovia, Chuvashia, Kalmykia, and Tatarstan, as well as to remote regions of Russia - Amur, Magadan, Sakhalin, Khabarovsk Krai, Yakutia, the Jewish Autonomous Region, and Chukotka.\n\nFuel shortage in Kamchatka became so severe that residents began filing complaints with the police. Shortages also appeared at gas stations in Voronezh, Kursk, and Belgorod.\n\nIn occupied Luhansk and Donetsk, the situation is catastrophic: to get gasoline, people have to wait in massive queues. At some stations, gasoline is sold only with special vouchers.\n\nThe crisis has also affected Leningrad and Moscow regions. In some areas of the Russian capital, Lukoil gas stations have even banned the sale of gasoline in jerrycans to prevent hoarding.",

It was the fight of all Germans—those behind and beyond the Iron Curtain of Soviet occupation, and those in the island of freedom in West Berlin.\n\nGermany’s reunification 35 years ago hastened our independence. Germany’s leadership today helps safeguard our independence and that of all Europe. \n\nWe value Germany’s leadership and support for Ukraine. German unity works today to ensure strength and unity across Europe.\n\nI thank @Bundeskanzler and all Germans from all 16 federal states for your decisive support of Ukraine in resisting Moscow’s new attempts to divide Europe. No one has the right to tear any nation apart. We stand together. We stand united.",

Ihr habt eine einfache, aber kraftvolle Wahrheit gezeigt: Jegliche Mauern und Trennlinien, die Moskau im Herzen Europas oder in anderen Teilen der Welt errichtet, können niemals der Kraft des Volkes und der Demokratie widerstehen.\n\nEs war der entschlossene Wille des deutschen Volkes, der den Fall der Berliner Mauer herbeiführte und später die Deutsche Einheit möglich machte. Es war der gemeinsame Kampf aller Deutschen – jener hinter und jenseits des Eisernen Vorhangs der sowjetischen Besatzung und jener auf der Insel der Freiheit in West-Berlin.\n\nDie deutsche Wiedervereinigung vor 35 Jahren beschleunigte die Wiedererlangung unserer Unabhängigkeit. Deutschlands Führungsrolle trägt heute dazu bei, unsere Unabhängigkeit und die ganz Europas zu sichern.\n\nWir schätzen Deutschlands Führungskraft und Unterstützung für die Ukraine. Die Deutsche Einheit wirkt heute und trägt dazu bei, Stärke und Zusammenhalt in ganz Europa zu gewährleisten.\n\nIch danke dem @Bundeskanzler und allen Deutschen aus allen 16 Bundesländern für eure entschlossene Unterstützung der Ukraine im Widerstand gegen Moskaus neue Versuche, Europa zu spalten.

This, unfortunately, is again a pro-Western logic.\n\nAlongside the so-called formula for peace, they were forming and supporting the Kyiv regime based on principles of neo-Nazism, extremism, and terrorism. They engaged in blatant provocations and staged simulations, such as Bucha. They invent stories about the alleged abduction of tens of thousands, escalating to millions, of Ukrainian children, somehow blaming Russia for this, and so on.\n\nSo once again, this is just another cover-up, another classic tactic.\n\nIf Kyiv truly wants to end the conflict, they know what needs to be done. The current territorial realities must be recognized, Ukraine must be returned to the origins of its statehood - that is, its neutral status must be restored, claims to NATO membership abandoned, and Nazi ideology renounced.\"",

      "summary": "Direct answer\n\nSince the morning’s social-media reports, the dominant developments are: (1) an intensification and geographic expansion of drone and long‑range strike operations by Ukraine into Russian territory (notably the Liutyi/“Lyutyy” strikes on the Orsk oil refinery ~1,400–1,600 km from the frontline); (2) massive Russian missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian energy and gas infrastructure with significant damage and outages; (3) continuing fierce tactical drone battles on the front (FPV attack drones, interceptor drones, and air‑defense countermeasures) with corresponding strain on Russian artillery and air defenses; and (4) heightened NATO–Europe political and operational activity around logistics (PURL), deterrence, and allied responses — including friction inside NATO about escalation signals and Article 4 use. Key primary posts: Orsk strike (Ukraine Liutyi drones) (https://x.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1974068480157618590, https://x.com/NOELreports/status/1974061475825057891), Russia’s mass strike on Naftogaz/gas infrastructure (35 missiles + 60 drones reported) (https://x.com/Gerashchenko_en/status/1974095695599505824, https://x.com/Saintjavelin/status/1974083545766261026), and the death of French photojournalist Antoni Lallican from a drone strike (https://x.com/jimsciutto/status/1974221423465123868, https://x.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1974212361104855525).\n\nKey themes and topics\n\n- Drone warfare dominance and escalation: Widespread reporting shows Ukraine using long‑range kamikaze drones (Liutyi/Lyutyy) to strike deep inside Russia (Orsk refinery, Perm Krai facilities) (https://x.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1974034908583440587, https://x.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1974117347595059449). Russian forces continue mass Shahed and other drone salvos against Ukrainian infrastructure, and FPV drones (including incendiary/napalm variants) are widely used at front‑line tactical scale (https://x.com/GrandpaRoy2/status/1974238340074414453, https://x.com/wartranslated/status/1974018546846847121).\n\n- Energy and logistics targeting: Both sides are striking energy systems. Ukraine’s deep strikes are disrupting Russian refining and fuel distribution (Orsk, Perm, and other refinery/railpower hits) with cascading gasoline shortages in many Russian regions (https://x.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1974136872403116033, https://x.com/Gerashchenko_en/status/1974131514666356869). Russia’s largest overnight attack on Ukrainian gas infrastructure (reported: 35 missiles + 60 drones) aimed to degrade heating/fuel ahead of colder months (https://x.com/Gerashchenko_en/status/1974095695599505824).\n\n- Air‑defense stress and adaptation: Ukrainian air defenses and Patriot batteries show large intercept tallies and symbolic kill markings (https://x.com/Osinttechnical/status/1974126115720736852, https://x.com/NOELreports/status/1974147439293817258). Multiple reports also document Ukrainian strikes on Russian long‑range radars and Sopka/P‑14F systems in Voronezh (https://x.com/NOELreports/status/1974147206619050168, https://x.com/wartranslated/status/1974134552974295374), and Russian attempts to respond have sometimes resulted in losses (Buk‑M1 destroyed in Rostov region) (https://x.com/NOELreports/status/1974180663445303410, https://x.com/wartranslated/status/1974171026805436523).\n\n- NATO and allied political/operational moves and debates: PURL (the Ukraine procurement/logistics route that speeds Western deliveries after Kyiv requests and NATO approval) is being actively coordinated and discussed with NATO and US interlocutors; Zelensky and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte aligned on steps to counter provocations and boost PURL contributions (https://x.com/Mylovanov/status/1974214574766244242, https://x.com/NOELreports/status/1974174626394542398). The US deliberations on long‑range cruise missiles (Tomahawks/Barracuda) for Ukraine remain unresolved and have prompted warnings from Putin about escalation (https://x.com/Mylovanov/status/1974077466387034292, https://x.com/Reuters/status/1974061868395241600). Internally, NATO allies show divisions on responses: disputes over Article 4 invocation (Mark Rutte vs Estonia) and differing national positions (Hungary/Orbán; Czech political shifts) were reported (https://x.com/bayraktar_1love/status/1974164108455899377, https://x.com/NOELreports/status/1974143861552304620, https://x.com/P_Kallioniemi/status/1974107545104187883).\n\nNotable patterns or trends\n\n- Increasing range and precision of Ukrainian drone strikes: Repeated posts document Ukrainian one‑way/long‑range drones reaching deep into Russia (Orsk, Perm, Azot/Berezniki) and striking energy/rail targets; these strikes are producing systemic fuel/refinery disruption and prompting domestic Russian panic/propaganda responses (https://x.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1974068480157618590, https://x.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1974117347595059449, https://x.com/Wartranslated/status/1974014740348231956).\n\n- High tempo of drone vs. counter‑drone operations: Frontline units are using multiple UAV types (FPVs, fiber‑optic guided, bombers) and field units have adapted tactics (nets, munitions drops, paired drones) while Russian field artillery and air defenses are increasingly reported as constrained or suffering losses/delays in munition supply (https://x.com/GrandpaRoy2/status/1974213981515448451, https://x.com/wartranslated/status/1974126468658757661).\n\n- Energy targeting as strategic lever: Both offensive sides focus on energy systems — Ukraine to degrade Russia’s ability to fuel and finance the war; Russia to blunt Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure and winter readiness. The result: large civilian impact (power outages in Donetsk, Kharkiv, Poltava; gasoline queues in Russian cities) (https://x.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1974167063431163937, https://x.com/wartranslated/status/1974155400351195621, https://x.com/wartranslated/status/1974099225584832626).\n\nImportant mentions, interactions, and data points\n\n- Orsk oil refinery strike(s): Ukrainian Liutyi drones struck Orsknefteorgsintez in Orenburg oblast (~1.4k km from front). Videos and multiple OSINT accounts indicate significant smoke, local evacuations and emerging fuel lines in Orsk (https://x.com/NOELreports/status/1974061475825057891, https://x.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1974117904628265244).\n\n- Naftogaz and Ukrainian energy infrastructure hit: Reports describe Russia’s most massive attack on Ukraine’s gas production (35 missiles + 60 drones) and critical damage forcing some sites to halt (https://x.com/Gerashchenko_en/status/1974095695599505824, https://x.com/Saintjavelin/status/1974083545766261026).\n\n- Civilian casualty among journalists: French photojournalist Antoni Lallican was killed in eastern Ukraine by a drone strike while reporting; colleagues were wounded. France and press organizations condemned the attack (https://x.com/jimsciutto/status/1974221423465123868, https://x.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1974212361104855525).\n\n- Tactical successes by Ukrainian drone units: Nemesis/Unmanned Forces units and Nemesis UAV Regiment reportedly detected and destroyed a Russian Grad MLRS swiftly after it fired; multiple videos show hunting and striking mobile systems (https://x.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1974227492773785771, https://x.com/wartranslated/status/1974154693602611663).\n\n- Air‑and‑space contest: UK Space Command reports regular Russian jamming of British military satellites; NATO/Western discussion includes counter‑jamming and resilience (https://x.com/Gerashchenko_en/status/1974062807604703727). Cyber operations and election/Hybrid targeting (France, Romania) led the EU to renew sanctions on individuals/entities behind hybrid operations (https://x.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1974218402274173199).\n\n- Tactical losses and attrition: Multiple reports of Russian air‑defense systems destroyed or lost in counter‑operations (Buk‑M1 in Rostov), and Ukrainian reports of high Russian personnel and material losses (daily tallies noted by Ukrainian general‑staff summaries) (https://x.com/NOELreports/status/1974180663445303410, https://x.com/NOELreports/status/1974005958759088425).\n\nNATO/European political and military actions (and frictions)\n\n- PURL logistics: PURL (Procurement Unified Request Line) is being used to speed weapons and munitions to Ukraine: Kyiv requests → NATO Supreme Commander approves → US and Europe coordinate funding/delivery. Zelensky and NATO leaders (Mark Rutte) discussed boosting PURL contributions and coordination ahead of Ramstein‑format meetings (https://x.com/Mylovanov/status/1974214574766244242, https://x.com/NOELreports/status/1974174626394542398).\n\n- Long‑range weapons debate and escalation concerns: US internal deliberations about supplying Tomahawk/Barracuda missiles (up to ~800 km) remain unresolved; Putin publicly warned that supplying Tomahawks would qualitatively escalate the conflict (https://x.com/Mylovanov/status/1974077466387034292, https://x.com/Reuters/status/1974061868395241600). US political signals (reported Trump authorization to assist targeting) are being parsed by analysts and risk prompting broader escalation debates (https://x.com/Mylovanov/status/1974077461131637179).\n\n- NATO internal politics: Allies are divided over signaling and escalation. Denmark reported repeated Russian naval provocations and hybrid maritime actions (https://x.com/Reuters/status/1974240586199625776, https://x.com/NOELreports/status/1974140730399441230). Reaction to airspace/drone incidents over EU bases and airports (Belgium/Germany/Munich airport closures) is prompting enhanced vigilance and political debate (https://x.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1974197261757268438, https://x.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1974053816694649118). Disagreements over Article 4 frequency and credibility were highlighted in a reported clash between Mark Rutte and Estonia’s prime minister (https://x.com/bayraktar_1love/status/1974164108455899377).\n\nHighly significant individual developments (short paragraphs)\n\nOrsk refinery strike (deep‑strike milestone): Video and multiple OSINT posts show Ukrainian Liutyi drones hitting the Orsknefteorgsintez refinery in Orenburg (capacity ~6.6 million t/yr), more than 1,400 km from Ukrainian lines. The strike has immediate economic and logistic consequences (black smoke, local evacuations, gasoline queues) and contributes to a broader Russian fuel shortage narrative across many regions (https://x.com/NOELreports/status/1974061475825057891, https://x.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1974117904628265244). This strike underscores Ukraine’s improving reach with one‑way drones and raises escalation sensitivity among NATO capitals.\n\nRussia’s massive attack on Ukrainian gas infrastructure: Ukraine reports Russia launched 35 missiles and 60 drones against Naftogaz facilities across Kharkiv/Poltava (large operational damage, some sites halted). This is described as Russia’s largest strike on Ukrainian gas production since the full‑scale invasion and is timed to worsen civilian energy security ahead of winter (https://x.com/Gerashchenko_en/status/1974095695599505824, https://x.com/Saintjavelin/status/1974083545766261026).\n\nDeath of a journalist and targeting of press: The killing of French photojournalist Antoni Lallican by a drone strike while embedded with Ukrainian troops has been confirmed by French authorities and widely condemned; the incident highlights the lethal risks to journalists and the blurred frontlines where press are targeted or caught in drone/FPV strikes (https://x.com/jimsciutto/status/1974221423465123868, https://x.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1974212361104855525).\n\nBottom line / implications\n\n- The war’s kinetic character is increasingly dominated by drone/long‑range strike campaigns that target energy and logistics as strategic levers; this is producing cross‑border effects (fuel shortages inside Russia, airport closures in Europe) and pressuring NATO/EU policy choices.\n- NATO and allies are actively coordinating logistics (PURL) and debating longer‑range munitions for Ukraine, while also managing internal political differences over escalation signaling and burden‑sharing.\n- The air‑and‑space contest (jamming, radar strikes, satellite resilience) and proliferating FPV/one‑way drones mean front‑line tactics and strategic targeting are evolving rapidly, increasing both operational effectiveness and escalation risk.\n\nSources (selected tweets cited inline above): Orsk/Liutyi reporting: https://x.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1974068480157618590 ; Naftogaz strike reporting: https://x.com/Gerashchenko_en/status/1974095695599505824 ; journalist killed: https://x.com/jimsciutto/status/1974221423465123868 ; PURL/NATO discussions: https://x.com/Mylovanov/status/1974214574766244242 and https://x.com/NOELreports/status/1974174626394542398 ; Tomahawk deliberations and Putin warning: https://x.com/Mylovanov/status/1974077466387034292 and https://x.com/Reuters/status/1974061868395241600 ; Denmark naval provocations: https://x.com/Reuters/status/1974240586199625776 ; air/space jamming: https://x.com/Gerashchenko_en/status/1974062807604703727 ; Nemesis/Grad hunt and tactical drone successes: https://x.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1974227492773785771 ; Buk‑M1 loss: https://x.com/NOELreports/status/1974180663445303410 ."
