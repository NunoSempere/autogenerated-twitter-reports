Hausfath reported September 2025 as the third warmest September in ERA5 and estimates 2025 may tie 2023 as the second warmest year (~1.48C above preindustrial) [hausfath Sept temp note](https://x.com/hausfath/status/1974166230664638702).\n- Extreme storms and ocean influence: Climate Central traced unusually warm ocean conditions to stronger, faster-intensifying hurricanes (Humberto, Imelda) and higher coastal risks; they estimated added ocean warmth increased Imelda's peak wind by ~10 mph and made some events much more likely [Climate Central on hurricanes & Imelda/Humberto](https://x.com/ClimateCentral/status/1973127514278207896) and [rapid intensification cases](https://x.com/ClimateCentral/status/1971963557958005144).\n- Drought, fire-weather and hydrology changes: Climate Central highlighted rising atmospheric 'thirst' increasing drought risk, more abnormally dry areas and more fire-weather days in parts of the US, slowing recovery and elevating wildfire risk [Climate Central drought/fire thread](https://x.com/ClimateCentral/status/1973865611865579587).\n- Climate system risks and cryosphere/sea-ice signals: Reporting and analyses flagged potential tipping-point risks (destabilization of a key Atlantic current / AMOC) and unusually low Antarctic sea-ice peak in 2025 (third smallest) as worrying system-level indicators [insideclimate on AMOC tipping risk](https://x.com/insideclimate/status/1974252113396949093) and [Carbon Brief on Antarctic sea ice](https://x.com/CarbonBrief/status/1974015067138953365).\n- Emissions, energy and policy: Carbon Brief and partners highlighted several policy/energy developments ‚Äî India‚Äôs power-sector CO2 fell (only the second fall in half a century) [Carbon Brief India analysis](https://x.com/CarbonBrief/status/1974206598294700341); China issued a new Paris pledge and Carbon Brief hosted webinars/Q&A unpacking its implications [Carbon Brief on China pledge & webinar](https://x.com/CarbonBrief/status/1973764366752473487); the IEA message that no new oil and gas are needed to meet 1.5C was reiterated and widely reported [Carbon Brief / IEA note](https://x.com/CarbonBrief/status/1974183174897872897). Carbon Brief also noted that after the UN summit pledges now cover about half of global emissions by 2035 [Carbon Brief on pledges coverage](https://x.com/CarbonBrief/status/1974031432822436316).\n- Health, social vulnerability and adaptation: Coverage linked climate change to public-health outcomes (fungal infections adapting, heat emergencies for rough sleepers, air-pollution impacts on myopia in children) and to social justice angles (climate rights manifesto ahead of COP30, community adaptation work) [Carbon Brief on fungal infections](https://x.com/CarbonBrief/status/1974085286352060891) and [Climate Reality climate-rights manifesto](https://x.com/ClimateReality/status/1974127368147988788).\n- Politics and institutions: Climate coverage included political friction‚ÄîU.S. federal program cuts/word bans and renewables resistance in some states, plus heated rhetoric at the UN (Trump's speech and pushback) [insideclimate on program risks](https://x.com/insideclimate/status/1973455420594454996) and [reports on UN rhetoric and responses](https://x.com/MichaelEMann/status/1973497270621577631).\n\nNotable patterns and trends\n- Warming is both global and seasonal-shifting: analyses show months and seasons are warming, leading to later last-90¬∞F days in some U.S. regions and more late-season heat events‚Äîthis is not isolated but part of a broader recent acceleration that many analysts are tracking [Climate Central seasonal heat tool](https://x.com/ClimateCentral/status/1973450820277641641) and [Carbon Brief factcheck on expected acceleration](https://x.com/CarbonBrief/status/1972890657598402784).\n- More frequent/intense extremes tied to ocean warmth: storms are intensifying faster (multiple cases of extreme rapid intensification this season) and warmer ocean conditions are being shown to increase peak storm intensity and likelihood of strong outcomes [Climate Central on ocean-fueled storms](https://x.com/ClimateCentral/status/1971963562722841019).\n- Mixed signals on emissions: some positive signs (India's one-off power-sector CO2 fall, GB running long clean-power stretches) coexist with continued fossil-fuel expansion, political resistance, and continued funding/support for fossil infrastructure‚Äîso progress is uneven [Carbon Brief on India CO2 fall](https://x.com/CarbonBrief/status/1973777002785030180) and [Carbon Brief on GB clean-power streak](https://x.com/CarbonBrief/status/1974051313785716779).\n- Growing attention to system risks and cascading tipping points: reporting and expert commentary increasingly emphasize risks of linked tipping elements (AMOC, ice sheets, forests) and what cascades would imply for global climate trajectories [Carbon Brief on cascading tipping points](https://x.com/CarbonBrief/status/1973741024976544229) and [insideclimate on AMOC concerns](https://x.com/insideclimate/status/1974252113396949093).\n\nImportant mentions, interactions and data points\n- Hausfath: September 2025 was the third warmest September in ERA5 at +1.47C above preindustrial; projects 2025 may tie 2023 as second warmest (~1.48C) if current trend holds [hausfath Sept warm note](https://x.com/hausfath/status/1974166230664638702).\n- Climate Central: college-football sites now see 88% more 'extremely hot days' since 1970; numerous regional posts documenting heat made multiple times more likely by human-caused climate change [Climate Central football-season heat findings](https://x.com/ClimateCentral/status/1974186750122865138).\n- Hurricanes: Imelda‚Äôs additional ocean warmth raised projected peak winds ~10 mph and was judged to make stronger outcomes much more likely; Humberto and other storms showed extreme rapid intensification this season [Climate Central on Imelda/Humberto](https://x.com/ClimateCentral/status/1973127514278207896) and [rapid RI cases](https://x.com/ClimateCentral/status/1971963557958005144).\n- Antarctic sea ice: 2025 winter peak ranked third smallest on record, a continuing cryosphere concern [Carbon Brief Antarctic sea-ice note](https://x.com/CarbonBrief/status/1974015067138953365).\n- Emissions & pledges: Carbon Brief notes that post-UN pledges cover roughly half of global emissions by 2035, while the IEA reiterated that holding to 1.5C requires no new oil and gas [Carbon Brief on pledges](https://x.com/CarbonBrief/status/1974031432822436316) and [IEA/Carbon Brief on oil & gas](https://x.com/CarbonBrief/status/1974183174897872897).\n- India power-sector: Analysis showed India‚Äôs power-sector CO2 decline is only the second such fall in ~50 years, a notable but rare short-term improvement [Carbon Brief India analysis](https://x.com/CarbonBrief/status/1974206598294700341).\n\nSignificant events/developments (one-paragraph highlights)\n1) Continued record warmth and seasonal shift: Multiple analyses reported unusually warm conditions and a trend toward longer, later heat seasons. Hausfath flagged September 2025 as the third warmest september in ERA5 and estimated 2025 could tie 2023 as the second warmest year (~1.48C) if trends persist, underscoring that high-yearly temperatures are continuing to cluster near recent record levels [hausfath Sept/2025 estimate](https://x.com/hausfath/status/1974166230664638702). Climate Central documented how that warming is pushing summer heat deeper into fall and increasing the frequency of extremely hot days in contexts like college football sites [Climate Central heat into fall](https://x.com/ClimateCentral/status/1974186750122865138).\n\n2) Storms and ocean-driven intensification: Warm ocean anomalies materially affected recent tropical storms. Climate Central documented cases of extreme rapid intensification this season (Humberto, Erin, Gabrielle) and showed Imelda likely strengthened by additional ocean heat (adding ~10 mph to its peak), illustrating how warmer oceans can convert typical storms into more destructive events [Climate Central on storm intensification & Imelda](https://x.com/ClimateCentral/status/1973127514278207896) and [rapid RI cases](https://x.com/ClimateCentral/status/1971963557958005144).\n\n3) Emissions/policy developments and geopolitical climate coverage: Carbon Brief led coverage of several policy/energy stories ‚Äî India‚Äôs power-sector CO2 fell (a rare occurrence) [Carbon Brief India analysis](https://x.com/CarbonBrief/status/1974206598294700341); China announced a new Paris pledge and Carbon Brief held webinars/Q&As to unpack its implications [Carbon Brief China pledge & webinar](https://x.com/CarbonBrief/status/1973764366752473487); and the IEA message that no new oil and gas are needed to meet 1.5C was reiterated and amplified, even as pledges now cover roughly half of global emissions by 2035 after recent diplomatic activity [Carbon Brief on IEA & pledges](https://x.com/CarbonBrief/status/1974183174897872897) [Carbon Brief on pledges coverage](https://x.com/CarbonBrief/status/1974031432822436316). These items together framed a week where climate diplomacy, emissions accounting and energy-supply debates were front and center.\n\n4) Climate-system risk signals: Reporting highlighted system-level risks ‚Äî weakening or destabilization of Atlantic circulation (AMOC) and low Antarctic sea-ice extent were foregrounded as potential tipping-point signals with far-reaching consequences. InsideClimate and scientists emphasized the cascading risk possibilities and the need to monitor these elements closely [insideclimate on AMOC risks](https://x.com/insideclimate/status/1974252113396949093) and [Carbon Brief on Antarctic sea ice low peak](https://x.com/CarbonBrief/status/1974015067138953365).\n\nOther notable items\n- Health and vulnerability stories emphasized heat emergencies for rough sleepers, fungal infections adapting to warming, air-pollution impacts on eyesight, and community-level adaptation programs and rights-based climate manifestos [Carbon Brief on heat emergencies](https://x.com/CarbonBrief/status/1973414615661846894) [Carbon Brief on fungal infections](https://x.com/CarbonBrief/status/1974085286352060891) [Climate Reality manifesto](https://x.com/ClimateReality/status/1974127368147988788).\n- Renewables and clean-power milestones were highlighted alongside political pushback: Great Britain ran on 100% clean power for record stretches and grid-battery prices and EV-grid integration advances were reported, even as some U.S. state-level politics and administration moves threatened program continuity or restricted siting for renewables [Carbon Brief GB 100% clean power](https://x.com/CarbonBrief/status/1974051313785716779) [insideclimate on state siting bills](https://x.com/insideclimate/status/1972690428735496386).\n\nBottom line\nLast week reinforced two linked realities: (1) the physical climate is producing clearer signs of accelerating seasonal warming, more persistent heat, and ocean-driven extreme-weather amplification; and (2) emissions and policy dynamics are mixed ‚Äî there are notable wins and analyses pointing to pathways consistent with 1.5C, but political headwinds, continued fossil-fuel influence and systemic risks mean urgency and vigilance remain critical.
