This disorder is important not only because it is the precursor to plasma-cell cancers, including multiple myeloma, solitary plasmacytoma, and Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia, but also because it is causally related to numerous serious nonmalignant disorders, collectively referred to as monoclonal gammopathy of clinical significance (MGCS). MGUS is characterized by a limited yet monoclonal proliferation of plasma cells secreting abnormal levels of immunoglobulins (antibodies) that are identical to each other, with the same amino acid sequence, referred to as monoclonal (M) proteins. These secreted M proteins are best appreciated as fully functioning human antibodies present in high concentrations that fortunately lack affinity to self-antigens (autoantibody characteristics) in most persons. As a result, MGUS remains asymptomatic in the absence of malignant transformation in most people. However, there is potential for serious harm if the M protein has or develops affinity for one or more organs in the body, resulting in MGCS. \n\nLearn more in the Review Article “Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance” by S.

Patients may also present with signs of bleeding due to ulceration, including bloody or tarry stool, hematemesis, and anemia. \n\nBezoars are classified on the basis of their composite materials. \n\n• 𝗣𝗵𝘆𝘁𝗼𝗯𝗲𝘇𝗼𝗮𝗿𝘀 are formed from fruit or vegetable material. \n• 𝗧𝗿𝗶𝗰𝗵𝗼𝗯𝗲𝘇𝗼𝗮𝗿𝘀 are formed from ingested hair and are associated with trichotillomania and coincident psychiatric conditions. \n• 𝗣𝗵𝗮𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗰𝗼𝗯𝗲𝘇𝗼𝗮𝗿𝘀 are formed from medications and are associated with excessive pill consumption as seen in cases of attempted suicide. They may cause an extended period of drug absorption. \n\nOther types are also described, including lactobezoars (composed of milk protein) in infants, and foreign-body bezoars. \n\nGastric bezoars are uncommon in the general population. The risk is higher in persons who ingest certain foods (e.g., persimmons, pineapples, raisins, and celery). \n\nAvailable data suggest that gastric bezoars are detected in fewer than 0.5% of esophagogastroduodenoscopies. Reduced gastric motility may contribute to bezoar development. There are several possible contributing factors: \n\n• 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗰𝗮𝘂𝘀𝗲𝘀 such as postsurgical changes (including changes related to bariatric or other gastric surgery). \n• 𝗠𝗲𝗱𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗱𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 such as delayed gastric emptying, diabetes, and autonomic neuropathy. \n• 𝗠𝗲𝗱𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 affecting gastric motility, including glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, narcotic agents (both of which this patient was taking), and tricyclic antidepressants. \n\nLearn more about the case and test your diagnostic and therapeutic skills in “A Fizzy Fix,” a new Interactive Medical Case: https://t.co/Yo1P81Va2v \n\n#MedEd #MedTwitter",

As a starting point, avoiding stigmatizing language about patients (e.g., in the medical record and clinical communication) and individualizing each patient (e.g., by means of thorough social history taking) can help reduce the risks of stereotyping. Understanding patients’ challenges and assets is an important part of diagnostic partnership — considering patients’ goals and individual and community-based resources supports collaborative planning for diagnostic evaluations. Empathic, collaborative communication can foster person-centered solutions anchored to the needs and values of each patient. The figure shows how these equity promoters can be incorporated into the diagnostic-reasoning framework. \n\nLearn more in the Review Article “Advancing Diagnostic Excellence through Medical Education in Diagnostic Equity\" by Denise M.

      "summary": "Direct answer\nLast week’s biorisk news was dominated by intensified avian influenza (H5N1) detections in wild birds and poultry with growing concerns about mammalian spillover and viral adaptation; widespread measles activity and preventable deaths (including a congenital measles death in Alberta); a localized but serious Ebola flare in the DRC with treatment deployment; and multiple concurrent outbreaks in Africa (Rift Valley fever, mpox, cholera) and continuing poliovirus detections. These outbreak signals were accompanied by persistent public-health system strains (federal furloughs/shutdown impacts and regulatory delays) that could hamper response and vaccination access.\n\nKey themes and topics\n- Avian influenza (H5N1): Rising detections in commercial and backyard flocks and many wild-bird findings across multiple U.S. states and internationally; depopulation/culling actions and concern about increased host range and replication in mammals (surveillance and research/preprints flagged). See coverage of expanding poultry detections in Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin and other states (https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1974171761240383944) and analysis/early alerts about H5 activity and adaptation (https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1972774619708010886).\n- Vaccine-preventable disease resurgence: Measles outbreaks continuing in Canada, the U.S., and elsewhere, with tragic preventable deaths (congenital measles death in Alberta) and clusters in Minnesota, South Carolina and New Mexico (https://x.com/DrNeilStone/status/1973982293997072443; https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1973488245661982853; https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1974090956820656382).\n- Ebola in DRC: A limited Kasai-region outbreak with dozens of cases and substantial fatalities; international partners supporting detection, care, vaccines and therapeutics, and deployment of the monoclonal treatment Ibanga (MAB114) noted as a lifesaving advance (https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1974089811423342621; https://x.com/AfricaCDC/status/1972670225888715035).\n- Other zoonotic and vectorborne threats: Rift Valley fever surges in Senegal and Mauritania; chikungunya transmission risk and localized outbreaks (WHO flagged potential for spread) (https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1974062560958611460; https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1974208763893522640).\n- Global public-health capacity & policy: Federal government shutdown/furlough announcements affecting HHS/CDC activities and delays in approvals that limit low-income children’s access to updated COVID vaccines and other programs (https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1973494274051215451; https://x.com/statnews/status/1973161801777914137).\n\nNotable patterns and trends\n- Convergence of multiple outbreaks: Africa continues to manage simultaneous threats (Ebola, RVF, mpox, cholera), increasing the need for coordination and surge capacity. Africa CDC briefings and cross-agency MOUs were highlighted (https://x.com/AfricaCDC/status/1973659493746520481).\n- Increased detection activity and geographic spread for H5N1 in September: many wild-bird detections, several commercial flock outbreaks, and large culling events (e.g., Wisconsin depopulation), plus reports of infections in companion animals and dairy/cattle surveillance—indicating elevated spillover risk and economic disruption (https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1971774449021030725; https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1973405931284189589).\n- Vaccine-preventable disease harms tied to under-vaccination and delays: measles cases remain concentrated among the unvaccinated, with domestic travel and family clusters repeatedly noted; studies and reports concurrently emphasize vaccine benefits (HPV/RSV/flu data referenced) (https://x.com/DrNeilStone/status/1974105144179781720; https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1974213775382253576).\n- Strain on public-health infrastructure: staffing and funding disruptions (furloughs, program changes) were repeatedly flagged as risks to surveillance, outbreak response, and vaccine distribution (https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1973494274051215451).\n\nImportant mentions, interactions, and data points\n- Measles: Canada’s Alberta reported a congenital measles death; U.S. measles total reported at ~1,544 with Minnesota seeing a spike and multiple localized outbreaks in states including South Carolina and Utah (https://x.com/HelenBranswell/status/1974147593488978119; https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1973488245661982853; https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1974090665987616876).\n- Avian influenza/H5N1: New commercial poultry detections in multiple U.S. states (Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Minnesota turkey farm, La Sueur MN) and many wild-bird findings reported by USDA surveillance; domestic cat infections tracked (https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1972751315009712607; https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1972844369977000397; https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1973405931284189589).\n- DRC Ebola (Kasai): About 64 confirmed/probable cases, 42 deaths reported; transmission appears more localized than initial explosive spread; partners scaling diagnostics, vaccination and treatment access (https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1974089811423342621; https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1973448244224024833; https://x.com/AfricaCDC/status/1972670225888715035).\n- Polio: Pakistan and Nigeria reported new cases including wild poliovirus type 1 and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 detections (https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1974163005106450620).\n- Rift Valley fever: Confirmed case counts in Senegal doubled within days and deaths reported in Mauritania (https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1974062560958611460; https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1974065464650137865).\n- Public health operations: HHS/CDC furlough plans and shutdown impacts flagged as affecting non-critical activities; vaccine approval delays left states unable to order updated COVID shots for low-income children (https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1973494274051215451; https://x.com/statnews/status/1973161801777914137).\n\nSignificant events (one-paragraph notes)\n1) Congenital measles death in Alberta and broader measles spikes: A premature/ congenital measles death in Alberta (mother infected late in pregnancy) highlighted the real-world consequences of ongoing measles outbreaks; provinces and several U.S. states reported new cases and exposures, emphasizing that under-vaccination and travel-linked clusters continue to drive preventable severe outcomes (see reports and commentary: https://x.com/DrNeilStone/status/1973982293997072443; https://x.com/HelenBranswell/status/1974147593488978119; https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1973488245661982853).\n\n2) Marked uptick in H5N1 detections with mammalian concerns: Multiple commercial flock outbreaks, large-scale culling, and widespread wild-bird detections across U.S. states and internationally were reported, alongside preprints and analyses pointing to H5N1’s evolving host range and improved replication in mammals—raising surveillance and One Health urgency for farms, companion animals, dairy surveillance, and human exposure monitoring (https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1974171761240383944; https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1972774619708010886; https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1973384000149368907).\n\n3) DRC Kasai Ebola outbreak and therapeutic deployment: The Kasai outbreak reached dozens of cases with high case-fatality; WHO, Africa CDC and partners scaled diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics with early deployment of the monoclonal antibody Ibanga (MAB114) noted as an important response advance (https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1974089811423342621; https://x.com/AfricaCDC/status/1972670225888715035).\n\nBottom line\nLast week reinforced the interconnected nature of biorisks: concurrent animal and human outbreaks (H5N1, measles, RVF, polio, Ebola) plus stresses on public-health operations underscore the need for sustained surveillance, vaccination coverage, One Health coordination, and protecting response capacity. Sources above provide the direct reporting and expert commentary cited."
