Direct answer
Last week’s biorisk news was dominated by intensified avian influenza (H5N1) detections in wild birds and poultry with growing concerns about mammalian spillover and viral adaptation; widespread measles activity and preventable deaths (including a congenital measles death in Alberta); a localized but serious Ebola flare in the DRC with treatment deployment; and multiple concurrent outbreaks in Africa (Rift Valley fever, mpox, cholera) and continuing poliovirus detections. These outbreak signals were accompanied by persistent public-health system strains (federal furloughs/shutdown impacts and regulatory delays) that could hamper response and vaccination access.

Key themes and topics
- Avian influenza (H5N1): Rising detections in commercial and backyard flocks and many wild-bird findings across multiple U.S. states and internationally; depopulation/culling actions and concern about increased host range and replication in mammals (surveillance and research/preprints flagged). See coverage of expanding poultry detections in Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin and other states (https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1974171761240383944) and analysis/early alerts about H5 activity and adaptation (https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1972774619708010886).
- Vaccine-preventable disease resurgence: Measles outbreaks continuing in Canada, the U.S., and elsewhere, with tragic preventable deaths (congenital measles death in Alberta) and clusters in Minnesota, South Carolina and New Mexico (https://x.com/DrNeilStone/status/1973982293997072443; https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1973488245661982853; https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1974090956820656382).
- Ebola in DRC: A limited Kasai-region outbreak with dozens of cases and substantial fatalities; international partners supporting detection, care, vaccines and therapeutics, and deployment of the monoclonal treatment Ibanga (MAB114) noted as a lifesaving advance (https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1974089811423342621; https://x.com/AfricaCDC/status/1972670225888715035).
- Other zoonotic and vectorborne threats: Rift Valley fever surges in Senegal and Mauritania; chikungunya transmission risk and localized outbreaks (WHO flagged potential for spread) (https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1974062560958611460; https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1974208763893522640).
- Global public-health capacity & policy: Federal government shutdown/furlough announcements affecting HHS/CDC activities and delays in approvals that limit low-income children’s access to updated COVID vaccines and other programs (https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1973494274051215451; https://x.com/statnews/status/1973161801777914137).

Notable patterns and trends
- Convergence of multiple outbreaks: Africa continues to manage simultaneous threats (Ebola, RVF, mpox, cholera), increasing the need for coordination and surge capacity. Africa CDC briefings and cross-agency MOUs were highlighted (https://x.com/AfricaCDC/status/1973659493746520481).
- Increased detection activity and geographic spread for H5N1 in September: many wild-bird detections, several commercial flock outbreaks, and large culling events (e.g., Wisconsin depopulation), plus reports of infections in companion animals and dairy/cattle surveillance—indicating elevated spillover risk and economic disruption (https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1971774449021030725; https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1973405931284189589).
- Vaccine-preventable disease harms tied to under-vaccination and delays: measles cases remain concentrated among the unvaccinated, with domestic travel and family clusters repeatedly noted; studies and reports concurrently emphasize vaccine benefits (HPV/RSV/flu data referenced) (https://x.com/DrNeilStone/status/1974105144179781720; https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1974213775382253576).
- Strain on public-health infrastructure: staffing and funding disruptions (furloughs, program changes) were repeatedly flagged as risks to surveillance, outbreak response, and vaccine distribution (https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1973494274051215451).

Important mentions, interactions, and data points
- Measles: Canada’s Alberta reported a congenital measles death; U.S. measles total reported at ~1,544 with Minnesota seeing a spike and multiple localized outbreaks in states including South Carolina and Utah (https://x.com/HelenBranswell/status/1974147593488978119; https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1973488245661982853; https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1974090665987616876).
- Avian influenza/H5N1: New commercial poultry detections in multiple U.S. states (Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Minnesota turkey farm, La Sueur MN) and many wild-bird findings reported by USDA surveillance; domestic cat infections tracked (https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1972751315009712607; https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1972844369977000397; https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1973405931284189589).

- Public health operations: HHS/CDC furlough plans and shutdown impacts flagged as affecting non-critical activities; vaccine approval delays left states unable to order updated COVID shots for low-income children (https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1973494274051215451; https://x.com/statnews/status/1973161801777914137).

Significant events (one-paragraph notes)
1) Congenital measles death in Alberta and broader measles spikes: A premature/ congenital measles death in Alberta (mother infected late in pregnancy) highlighted the real-world consequences of ongoing measles outbreaks; provinces and several U.S. states reported new cases and exposures, emphasizing that under-vaccination and travel-linked clusters continue to drive preventable severe outcomes (see reports and commentary: https://x.com/DrNeilStone/status/1973982293997072443; https://x.com/HelenBranswell/status/1974147593488978119; https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1973488245661982853).

2) Marked uptick in H5N1 detections with mammalian concerns: Multiple commercial flock outbreaks, large-scale culling, and widespread wild-bird detections across U.S. states and internationally were reported, alongside preprints and analyses pointing to H5N1’s evolving host range and improved replication in mammals—raising surveillance and One Health urgency for farms, companion animals, dairy surveillance, and human exposure monitoring (https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1974171761240383944; https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1972774619708010886; https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1973384000149368907).

3) DRC Kasai Ebola outbreak and therapeutic deployment: The Kasai outbreak reached dozens of cases with high case-fatality; WHO, Africa CDC and partners scaled diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics with early deployment of the monoclonal antibody Ibanga (MAB114) noted as an important response advance (https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1974089811423342621; https://x.com/AfricaCDC/status/1972670225888715035).

Bottom line
Last week reinforced the interconnected nature of biorisks: concurrent animal and human outbreaks (H5N1, measles, RVF, polio, Ebola) plus stresses on public-health operations underscore the need for sustained surveillance, vaccination coverage, One Health coordination, and protecting response capacity.
