# Autogenerated reports from Twitter

This repository contains weekly autogenerated reports, produced with the tooling that is also used at [tools.sentinel-team.org](https://tools.sentinel-team.org/twit.html) about a variety of topic. The hope is that tooling such as this might replace manually browsing twitter for insights. 

## Built with

- bash
- golang (on the server)
- secret [Sentinel](https://sentinel-team.org/) sauce.

## Usage

Check out the folder corresponding to a given week, e.g., 39 for week 39 of 2025. To create reports, alter the makefile and run it with `make`, or run `./commission-job.sh`, for instance:

```sh
$ ./commission-job.sh <filter_question> <summarization_question> <list_name> <output_file_name>
$ ./commission-job.sh "Is this tweet talking about an important whitehouse action?" "Summarize what the White house is up to this week." "whitehouse" "03-whitehouse.md"
```
