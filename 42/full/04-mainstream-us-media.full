She was 87.\n\n\"Susan's voice was not only a cornerstone of NPR ‚Äî it was a cornerstone of American life,\" NPR‚Äôs president and CEO Katherine Maher said Thursday. \"She showed that journalism could be both rigorous and deeply personal. She inspired countless journalists to believe they could explore life and truth, and lead with both authority and warmth.\"\n\nIn 1972, at a time when women had few opportunities in broadcast journalism, Stamberg became the trailblazing host of NPR‚Äôs afternoon program ‚ÄúAll Things Considered.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúNPR was a startup. So there weren't 1,000 people ahead of you in the job you were dying to get. That makes it tough for anybody, men or women, but particularly difficult for a woman,‚Äù Stamberg told PBS News Hour‚Äôs Judy Woodruff in 2021.\n\nWhile NPR‚Äôs other ‚Äúfounding mothers‚Äù ‚Äì Linda Wertheimer, Nina Totenberg and the late Cokie Roberts ‚Äì spent most of their careers covering politics, Stamberg‚Äôs reporting often focused on culture. Her notable interviews included civil rights figure Rosa Parks, PBS children‚Äôs television host Fred Rogers and writer Joan Didion. \n\nIn 1987, Stamberg became the first host of ‚ÄúWeekend Edition Sunday,‚Äù where she launched the Sunday puzzle, a weekly on-air quiz with Will Shortz.\n\nThat same year, she introduced a national audience to mechanics Ray and Tom Magliozzi for a weekly segment about car repair. Nine months later, the brothers had their own national radio program, ‚ÄúCar Talk.‚Äù \n\nEach Thanksgiving, she shared her mother-in-law's recipe for cranberry relish with NPR listeners. The recipe, taken from a 1959 New York Times clipping of Craig Claiborne's recipe for cranberry relish, includes whole raw cranberries, onion, sugar, sour cream and horseradish in a mixture that some listeners called ‚ÄúPepto Bismol pink.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThat's going to be on my obituary,‚Äù she said last month upon her retirement after more than 50 years at NPR. ‚ÄúIt'll be the lead, you know?‚Äù \n\nStamberg‚Äôs honors included induction into the National Radio Hall of Fame and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.",

      "summary": "This week‚Äôs top developments: a flurry of high‚Äëstakes diplomacy and security moves in Europe, the Caribbean and the Middle East; major U.S. legal and political fights at home; market volatility tied to bank worries and AI; and several notable domestic and international crises (coups, natural disasters, public‚Äëhealth alerts).\n\n1) Trump‚ÄëZelenskyy meeting and Tomahawk/drones diplomacy ‚Äî potential shifts in the Ukraine war: President Trump hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to press for an end to the war and to discuss long‚Äërange Tomahawk missiles. Zelenskyy reportedly offered Ukrainian drones as part of an exchange, while Trump expressed concern about U.S. Tomahawk stockpiles and signaled he would consider options short of sending Tomahawks himself; the visit also followed a Trump call with Putin and set up a planned Trump‚ÄëPutin meeting in Budapest. (See [Zelenskiy meets Trump; Tomahawk/drones discussion](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1979278423702016295) and [Tomahawk reporting](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1979295103517630608)).\n\n2) U.S. strikes on suspected drug vessels off Venezuela and diplomatic fallout: The U.S. military carried out multiple strikes this week on boats the administration alleged were drug‚Äësmuggling vessels near Venezuela. For the first time, U.S. forces reportedly recovered survivors and detained them aboard a Navy ship, prompting Venezuelan protests and a Venezuelan request to the U.N. Security Council. Trump also said Maduro had offered concessions to avoid conflict. These strikes have intensified tensions and raised questions about the legality and humanitarian consequences. (See [US strike with survivors](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1979282527572340929) and [Venezuela/U.S. exchange coverage](https://x.com/NewsHour/status/1979285238674084185)).\n\n3) John Bolton indictment / court appearance: Former national security adviser John Bolton was indicted on 18 counts alleging mishandling and transmission of classified material; he surrendered and pleaded not guilty. The case is a prominent legal escalation involving a former Trump official and has drawn wide coverage and legal analysis. (See [Bolton indictment / arraignment](https://x.com/NewsHour/status/1978994373070127605) and [Reuters coverage](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1979207030419095896)).\n\n4) Domestic legal and political fights ‚Äî National Guard deployment, shutdown effects, and submissions to courts: The administration sought to deploy National Guard troops in Illinois for immigration enforcement; appeals courts and the Supreme Court were asked to weigh in, with courts blocking or pausing some deployment moves and the White House filing emergency requests to the Supreme Court. Meanwhile the federal government shutdown continued to ripple through agencies (furloughs, paused projects and potential furloughs at key civilian nuclear agencies), contributing to political standoffs and operational strain. (See [Supreme Court/appeals coverage of National Guard deployment](https://x.com/politico/status/1979288149529354544) and [shutdown impacts / furloughs reporting](https://x.com/NewsHour/status/1978970363355644078)).\n\n5) Global and regional crises: Madagascar coup leader sworn in after youth‚Äëled protests and an army takeover; heavy violence and a stampede at Kenya‚Äôs Raila Odinga funeral produced casualties; severe storm surge and flooding in western Alaska triggered the largest airlift in state history to evacuate hundreds of people; and Russia‚Äôs strikes continued to batter Ukrainian energy infrastructure amid the diplomatic attention on Ukraine. Each of these events drew immediate humanitarian and political consequences. (See [Madagascar leader sworn in](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1979272453529465036), [Odinga funeral stampede](https://x.com/NewsHour/status/1979291837958398296), [Alaska airlift](https://x.com/NewsHour/status/1979252766510846428), and [Russian attacks on Ukraine energy grid](https://x.com/NBCNews/status/1979276348980928689)).\n\n6) Prince Andrew relinquishes royal titles: Britain‚Äôs Prince Andrew announced he will no longer use his royal titles amid renewed scrutiny over past scandals and ties to Jeffrey Epstein; the move produced immediate headlines and palace attention. (See [Prince Andrew relinquishes titles](https://x.com/ABC/status/1979286586694209822)).\n\n7) Politics, protests and scandals: High‚Äëprofile debates, protests and political scandals marked the week ‚Äî a fiery New York City mayoral debate between the top three candidates after Eric Adams suspended his reelection bid; fallout from a leaked Young Republicans group chat with racist and antisemitic messages that prompted organizational suspensions; large ‚ÄúNo Kings‚Äù protests and related partisan backlash; and arrests/protests surrounding ICE operations in Chicago. (See [NYC debate recap](https://x.com/ABC/status/1979297707035349062), [Young Republicans fallout](https://x.com/politico/status/1979223963550077023), and [No Kings / protests coverage](https://x.com/ABC/status/1979224092772389055)).\n\n8) Markets and corporate moves ‚Äî bank jitters, AI gains and drug price/manufacturing actions: Global markets saw volatility as bank‚Äëstock weakness and regional bank loan concerns rattled investors; gold hit multi‚Äëyear highs. At the same time investors cheered AI‚Äëlinked products (e.g., Meta AI glasses lifted EssilorLuxottica) and chip/AI supply chain news (TSMC/Nvidia wafer manufacturing). On pharmaceuticals and health policy, the White House announced deals/pressure to lower prices for fertility and obesity drugs (EMD Serono/Merck/Novonordisk coverage), and regulators in India pushed drugmakers to upgrade facilities after fatal tainted cough syrup cases. (See [banking and market jitters](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1979131531957248242), [EssilorLuxottica/Meta AI glasses](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1979276230978363425), and [IVF/drug pricing deals](https://x.com/NewsHour/status/1979264514001416635)).\n\nKey themes and notable patterns\n- Geopolitical high diplomacy: concentrated diplomacy (Trump with Zelenskyy and Putin) as administrations try to leverage meetings to alter long wars. (See [Trump‚ÄëZelenskyy](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1979278423702016295)).\n- Militarized interdiction beyond conventional battlefields: U.S. lethal actions against suspected drug smuggling in international waters with survivors now detained ‚Äî raising legal, humanitarian and diplomatic debates. (See [strikes near Venezuela](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1979282527572340929)).\n- Judicial and institutional friction at home: criminal indictments of high‚Äëprofile figures, court‚Äëblocked executive actions (National Guard deployment), and the ongoing government shutdown creating operational and political strain. (See [Bolton indictment](https://x.com/NewsHour/status/1978994373070127605) and [National Guard legal fight](https://x.com/politico/status/1979288149529354544)).\n- Market bifurcation: bank/regional lending concerns and safe‚Äëhaven moves (gold), alongside concentrated gains tied to AI and chip demand.\n- Domestic political polarization and protest: ‚ÄúNo Kings‚Äù protests, ICE/immigration confrontations, mayoral and gubernatorial campaign flashpoints, and the fallout from internal party chat revelations.\n\nImportant data points and interactions\n- Multiple U.S. strikes on Caribbean vessels this week; at least some strikes produced survivors now held by U.S. forces (Reuters/NBC reporting). (See [survivors aboard U.S. ship](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1979282527572340929)).\n- John Bolton indicted on 18 counts; he pleaded not guilty at arraignment. (See [Bolton plea](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1979207030419095896)).\n- Courts temporarily blocked the administration‚Äôs attempt to deploy the National Guard in Illinois; the White House filed emergency requests with the Supreme Court. (See [legal fight over deployment](https://x.com/politico/status/1979288149529354544)).\n- The federal shutdown continued into a third week (and beyond), prompting furlough notices, paused projects and growing pressure on federal programs and employees. (See [shutdown effects](https://x.com/NewsHour/status/1978970363355644078)).\n- Prince Andrew agreed to stop using his Duke of York title, a major royal‚Äëfamily development. (See [Prince Andrew step back](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1979253999745290648)).\n\nIf you want, I can: produce a short timeline of these events across the week; generate a one‚Äëpage brief for distribution to colleagues; or build a prioritized watchlist of follow‚Äëup items (courts, diplomatic summits, market signals, humanitarian developments)."
