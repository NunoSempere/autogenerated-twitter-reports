            "text": "George Santos was somewhat of a “rogue,” but there are many rogues throughout our Country that aren’t forced to serve seven years in prison. I started to think about George when the subject of Democrat Senator Richard “Da Nang Dick” Blumenthal came up again. As everyone remembers, “Da Nang” stated for almost twenty years that he was a proud Vietnam Veteran, having endured the worst of the War, watching the Wounded and Dead as he raced up the hills and down the valleys, blood streaming from his face. He was “a Great Hero,” he would leak to any and all who would listen — And then it happened! He was a COMPLETE AND TOTAL FRAUD. He never went to Vietnam, he never saw Vietnam, he never experienced the Battles there, or anywhere else. His War Hero status, and even minimal service in our Military, was totally and completely MADE UP. This is far worse than what George Santos did, and at least Santos had the Courage, Conviction, and Intelligence to ALWAYS VOTE REPUBLICAN! George has been in solitary confinement for long stretches of time and, by all accounts, has been horribly mistreated. Therefore, I just signed a Commutation, releasing George Santos from prison, IMMEDIATELY. Good luck George, have a great life!\n\n(TS: 17 Oct 18:04 ET)​​​‍​​‌‍​​‌‍​​​​​​‌‍​​​​‌‍​​​​​​​​​​‌‍​​‌‍​​​​​​​​‌‍​​​​​​​‌‍​​​​​​​​‌‍​​​​​​​​‌‍​‌‍​​​​​​​​​​‌‍​​‌‍​​‌‍​​​​​​​​​​‌‍​​‌‍​​​​​‌‍",

It was my Great Honor to win North Carolina six times, including Primaries, in 2016, 2020, and 2024, and this new Map would give the fantastic people of North Carolina the opportunity to elect an additional MAGA Republican in the 2026 Midterm Elections, which would be A HUGE VICTORY for our America First Agenda, not just in North Carolina, but across our Nation. Remember, I won the Electoral College, 312-226, Counties Nationwide, 2,700 to 525, all seven Swing States (A LANDSLIDE!), and now I have the best Polling Numbers I've ever had. Our Party has never been more UNITED, and we are getting so much done for the American People because of it. Therefore, I encourage all of my Republican friends in the North Carolina Legislature to work as hard as they can to pass this new Map so that we can continue our incredible Record of SUCCESS. It is wonderful to see Republicans in “The Tar Heel State” standing up to Save our Country and, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.

President Putin congratulated me and the United States on the Great Accomplishment of Peace in the Middle East, something that, he said, has been dreamed of for centuries. I actually believe that the Success in the Middle East will help in our negotiation in attaining an end to the War with Russia/Ukraine. President Putin thanked the First Lady, Melania, for her involvement with children. He was very appreciative, and said that this will continue. We also spent a great deal of time talking about Trade between Russia and the United States when the War with Ukraine is over. At the conclusion of the call, we agreed that there will be a meeting of our High Level Advisors, next week. The United States’ initial meetings will be led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, together with various other people, to be designated. A meeting location is to be determined. President Putin and I will then meet in an agreed upon location, Budapest, Hungary, to see if we can bring this “inglorious” War, between Russia and Ukraine, to an end. President Zelenskyy and I will be meeting tomorrow, in the Oval Office, where we will discuss my conversation with President Putin, and much more. I believe great progress was made with today’s telephone conversation.\n\n(TS: 16 Oct 13:11 ET)​​​‍​​‌‍​​‌‍​​​​​​‌‍​​​​‌‍​​​​​​​​​‌‍​​​​​‌‍​​​​​​​​​​‌‍​​​​​​‌‍​​​​​​​‌‍​​​​​​​​​‌‍​​​​​​‌‍​​​​​​​​​‌‍​​​​​​​​‌‍​​​​​‌‍​​‌‍​​​​‌‍​​​​​​​​​‌‍",

      "summary": "Direct answer — what happened: This week saw a clear escalation in and around Venezuela: the United States intensified kinetic and covert pressure against suspected drug-trafficking networks operating off Venezuela’s coast (including multiple strikes on narco-vessels and a reported strike on a drug-carrying submersible), the White House publicly authorized CIA covert operations targeting elements inside Venezuela, and Caracas pushed back diplomatically to the United Nations while regional governments voiced concern. Major US military activity and leadership changes in the region reinforced the posture of pressure and deterrence.\n\nKey events and why they matter:\n- Repeated US strikes on suspected drug boats and a reported strike on a drug-carrying submarine: Media and defense outlets reported multiple US strikes in the Southern Caribbean this week, with US officials saying one strike targeted a drug-carrying submarine and other reports noting survivors were taken aboard a US Navy warship after a strike. Coverage: [How many US strikes on boats near Venezuela?](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1979286314672439699), [Trump says a recent US strike targeted a drug-carrying submarine](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1979288810190934210), and [US Navy warship holding survivors from strike](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1979282527572340929). USNINews also noted this was at least the sixth strike on suspected Venezuelan drug boats this campaign week ([USNINews](https://x.com/USNINews/status/1979270618840187155)). Independent reporting/analysis threads and defense accounts tracked survivor/rescue details and follow-on reporting ([sentdefender on casualties and rescue](https://x.com/sentdefender/status/1979211453887639827)).\n\n- White House authorization of CIA covert operations in Venezuela: The administration publicly authorized covert CIA activities to increase pressure on Nicolás Maduro’s government, citing concerns including drug trafficking and prisoner issues; this is a major policy shift in tools explicitly being used to influence Venezuela. See Reuters coverage: [Trump authorizes CIA covert operations in Venezuela](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1978706220849492316) and related summaries ([Reuters roundup](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1978772954490994703)).\n\n- Venezuelan diplomatic pushback at the UN and regional political reactions: Venezuela asked the UN Security Council to declare the US strikes illegal and to back Venezuelan sovereignty after the attacks off its coast ([Venezuela asks UN Security Council](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1979008224377311700)). Colombia’s president publicly warned of possible consequences for Colombia following US plans for CIA operations ([Colombian president warns](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1978728869718065652)), and other regional actors expressed concern.\n\n- Increased visible US military posture / demonstrations: The US flew demonstrative missions near Venezuela, notably B-52 strategic bomber flights escorted by Marine F-35s off the Venezuelan coast, and SOUTHCOM has been publicly active. See the flight photos and mission note ([sentdefender on B-52 and F-35 demonstration](https://x.com/sentdefender/status/1979257416006144421)) and SOUTHCOM messaging ([SOUTHCOM message](https://x.com/Southcom/status/1978917366047130095)).\n\n- SOUTHCOM leadership change amid the tensions: The admiral in charge of US forces in Latin America, Adm. Alvin Holsey, announced he will step down at year’s end, earlier than planned, a surprising leadership shift occurring while tensions are elevated ([Reuters on admiral stepping down](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1979010740364181609)).\n\nNotable patterns and trends:\n- Framing of operations as anti-narcotics / anti–\"narcoterrorist\": US messaging (and allied US political voices) repeatedly ties military and covert actions to counter-narcotics objectives; domestic and diplomatic narratives present these measures as targeting trafficking networks rather than as direct regime-change military operations (see multiple White House and allied tweets, e.g. [White House quote from Trump](https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1979289772146463060)).\n- Escalation across multiple instruments: kinetic strikes at sea, covert intelligence/covert action approvals, visible bomber/fighter patrols, and naval interdictions are being used in parallel — indicating a multi-domain pressure campaign rather than a single isolated event.\n- Regional diplomatic friction: Neighboring governments and regional leaders (e.g., Colombia’s president) are warning about spillover and consequences; Venezuela is appealing to international bodies for legal backing.\n- Political signaling and polarization: US political figures supportive of strong action (e.g., Rep. Carlos and other commentators) are vocally praising the administration’s measures and promoting opposition figures (e.g., Maria Corina Machado), while some US senators and diplomats are reported to be looking for ways to lower tensions or manage fallout ([senators hope to lower heat](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1979247295880204440)). Examples of vocal US support: [RepCarlos praising Trump actions and Machado](https://x.com/RepCarlos/status/1978936029450055867) and public endorsement of covert actions ([RepCarlos on CIA greenlight](https://x.com/RepCarlos/status/1978909055943839808)).\n\nImportant mentions, interactions, and data points:\n- Reports indicate multiple strikes (news outlets called out a sixth strike), survivors were recovered and held by a US Navy vessel after at least one strike, and US statements described targets as drug-trafficking semisubmersible vessels ([USNINews sixth strike](https://x.com/USNINews/status/1979270618840187155); [Reuters on survivors and strikes](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1979282527572340929)).\n- The White House framed actions in stark terms (public quotes from the President), and Reuters/others reported the decisive policy decision to allow covert CIA activity in Venezuela ([Reuters on CIA ops](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1978706220849492316)).\n- Venezuela formally requested UN Security Council action to label the strikes illegal, seeking international legal and diplomatic backing ([Venezuela asks UN Security Council](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1979008224377311700)).\n\nSignificant single developments (each a paragraph):\n1) Authorization of CIA covert operations: President Trump’s authorization for the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela is one of the most consequential developments this week because it institutionalizes a political/intelligence tool set directed at Maduro’s government and networks inside the country. This expands US levers beyond naval interdictions and strikes to clandestine means and has prompted concern from neighboring governments and calls for cautious oversight ([Reuters on CIA authorization](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1978706220849492316)).\n\n2) Repeated US maritime strikes and naval interdictions: A cluster of strikes against suspected narco-vessels — including one described as a drug-carrying semi‑submersible — and subsequent rescue/holding of survivors by US naval forces represents a tangible uptick in kinetic operations in the Southern Caribbean. Reporting emphasized both the operational scale (multiple strikes, described by some outlets as the sixth) and humanitarian/legal questions that have fueled Venezuela’s UN appeal ([USNINews sixth strike](https://x.com/USNINews/status/1979270618840187155); [Reuters on submarine strike and survivors](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1979288810190934210)).\n\nOverall assessment / risk outlook: The week shows a multi-pronged US campaign — kinetic, covert, and symbolic — focused on narcotics networks tied to or operating near Venezuela. That posture has increased diplomatic friction (Venezuela’s formal UN appeal, regional warnings from Colombia) and prompted some US lawmakers to urge cooling of tensions. The authorization of covert CIA activity and repeated strikes at sea are the two developments most likely to shape near-term trajectories: they raise the potential for further interdictions and diplomatic escalation, and they fuel domestic political messaging for both supporters and critics of more aggressive policy toward Maduro."
