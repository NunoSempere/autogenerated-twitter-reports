Treatments include minoxidil, antiandrogens, and nondrug options such as platelet-rich plasma or light or laser therapy. \n\nFigure 1 from the article illustrates the hair cycle with normal hair growth and with pattern hair loss. \n\nPanel A shows the hair cycle of a normal-scalp terminal hair. The cycle includes 3-to-6-year periods of active hair growth (anagen) separated by periods of inactivity. This latency phase is initiated by a brief period of apoptosis-driven regression of the inferior portion of the hair follicle and upward movement of the remaining follicle and its dermal papilla to the area immediately below the arrector pili muscle. This brief transition period (catagen) is followed by a quiescent period (telogen) that lasts several months. At the conclusion of telogen, the hair shaft is shed (exogen), anagen is reinitiated, and the anagen follicle moves downward along the collapsed follicular streamer to its former location in the subcutaneous tissue. Panel B shows the hair cycle in pattern hair loss. In male-pattern or female-pattern hair loss, the process of miniaturization of individual hairs in affected follicular units drives the degree and location of the hair loss. The dermal papilla and the bulb of affected hairs, which determine the diameter of the hair shaft, synchronously become smaller and the duration of the anagen phase, which determines the length of the hair shaft, becomes shorter over several cycles. An additional period of quiescence called kenogen follows telogen in pattern hair loss, which lengthens the latency phase between active anagen phases and increases the time that affected follicles and follicular ostia may remain empty of hair shafts. In severe pattern hair loss, this miniaturization process can evolve into actual follicular loss. The net result is a decrease in follicular density and volume. \n\nLearn more in the Clinical Practice article ‚ÄúHair Loss in Women‚Äù by Elise A.

The prevalence of this condition is 3 to 12% among women of European descent in their 20s and 30s, 14 to 28% among those in their 50s, and 56% among those older than 70 years of age. The prevalence is lower among Asian women ‚Äî 12 to 25% among those older than 70 years of age ‚Äî and is unknown among women of African descent owing to the common overlap of the clinical findings of female-pattern hair loss with those of early central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia. It is unclear whether the decrease in hair density or diameter (or both) commonly seen in older persons, known as senescent or involutional alopecia, is a distinct entity or a part of pattern hair loss (i.e., pattern hair loss that occurs in men or women). \n\nBoth male-pattern hair loss and female-pattern hair loss are characterized by progressive miniaturization of the hair follicle, a shortened anagen (growth) phase, and a prolonged latent phase. Scalp hair is arranged in follicular units of two to four terminal hairs (>60 Œºm in diameter) and one or two vellus hairs (<30 Œºm in diameter), with the degree of miniaturization specific to each individual hair. This miniaturization process leads to a progressive, but variable, decrease in the caliber, length, and number of hairs in an affected follicular unit. Female-pattern hair loss manifests as decreased hair density in a diffuse central or frontal accentuation pattern but without baldness (seen in figure). The rare manifestation of female-pattern hair loss in women that mimics that of male-pattern hair loss is usually related to marked hyperandrogenemia and, if accompanied by virilization, should arouse suspicion for a tumor. Female-pattern hair loss may first manifest between puberty and the late 20s (early-onset female-pattern hair loss) or in the late 40s through menopause (late-onset female-pattern hair loss). \n\nLearn more in the Clinical Practice article ‚ÄúHair Loss in Women‚Äù by Elise A.

Imaging revealed pulmonary opacities, thickening of the duodenal wall, and a thrombus in the right renal vein.  \n\nThe gastroenterology service was consulted for upper endoscopic evaluation of a foreign body identified on imaging. Timing of the procedure was influenced by the object type and its location within the gastrointestinal tract. Although the time of ingestion was uncertain, it was presumed to have occurred 2 weeks earlier. The object was unlikely to spontaneously pass because it was embedded within the kidney, where it had likely remained for weeks. Because of the proximity to vital organs, the team at MGH proceeded with immediate intervention. \n\nThe planning of this procedure involved a multidisciplinary team, including gastroenterology, surgery, and radiology services. Owing to the complexity of the procedure and the risk of bleeding, esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed in the operating room, with the patient in the supine position. \n\nThe endoscope was slowly advanced to the duodenum, where a foreign object was visualized that corresponded to the hyperdense object found on CT (Panel A). Owing to the orientation of the object, rat-tooth forceps were used to remove it (Panel B). After removal of the foreign body, the gastroscope was reintroduced to assess for bleeding at the site. No bleeding was observed either during the extraction of the foreign body or for 5 to 10 minutes after extraction (Panel C). The foreign body was identified as a wooden toothpick, which had been removed intact (Panel D). After the procedure, the patient‚Äôs condition remained stable, and he had an uneventful recovery. \n\nRead the full case details in ‚ÄúA 36-Year-Old Man with Abdominal Pain, Fever, and Hypoxemia,‚Äù a Case Record of the Massachusetts General Hospital, by G.

The appealing feature of this procedure is that it corrects the anatomical obstruction that is considered central to the self-reinforcing rise in intracranial pressure (ICP). In a summary of 19 reported series, the risk of subdural or intracerebral hematoma was shown to have been small (0.49%), but two deaths were reported. The same review reported a mean drop in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure of 13.3 cm of water. Patients receive aspirin and clopidogrel for up to 6 months after the procedure to prevent stent thrombosis. \n\nThe most serious limitation of venous sinus stenting is that the ICP is lowered, but not to a level in the normal range in some patients. If the ICP remains elevated, visual function may continue to deteriorate. Opening pressure cannot be checked immediately after stent placement, because lumbar puncture is contraindicated in patients receiving dual antiplatelet drugs. Many patients continue to receive acetazolamide owing to concern that stenting has been only partially effective. In various series, 15% of patients showed development of a new stenosis adjacent to the stent (seen in figure). Recurrent stenosis is evidence that ICP is still high, exposing the optic disks to ongoing damage precisely at the time decisive relief is paramount. A second stent can usually be inserted to lower ICP further, but sometimes a CSF shunt is needed to arrest vision loss. \n\nLearn more about treatments in the Review Article ‚ÄúIdiopathic Intracranial Hypertension‚Äù by Jonathan C.

      "summary": "Direct answer\nLast week‚Äôs biorisk news was dominated by widespread avian influenza activity (H5N1) in animals with ongoing spillover risk, new locally acquired human/pandemic-relevant infections (mpox clade 1, chikungunya), rising zoonotic outbreaks in Africa (Rift Valley fever, diphtheria signals), and growing concern about surveillance gaps in the United States caused by mass federal layoffs and a government shutdown that disrupted disease reporting.\n\nKey themes and topics\n- Avian influenza (H5N1): large and expanding animal outbreak footprint across North America and elsewhere, continued detection in wild birds, commercial farms, backyard flocks, and dairy herds; ongoing milk/dairy surveillance and multiple newly affected states. See Idaho dairy herd counts and the tally of infected herds (Idaho‚Äôs latest, its 108th; 1,081 total infected herds since spring 2024) [https://x.com/HelenBranswell/status/1979188823549485144] and USDA dairy vat surveillance status [https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1979206647160463629]. USDA and state reports recorded numerous wild-bird detections and multiple commercial outbreaks (for example, three large turkey farms in Minnesota) [https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1979014515048997244]. PAHO and US reporting noted many new wild-bird detections and at least one human case in the Americas region, underlining ongoing zoonotic risk [https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1978916875552563450].\n- Human zoonoses and local transmission: more instances of locally acquired infections beyond travel-associated cases ‚Äî notably clade 1 mpox (first U.S. locally acquired clade 1 case in California and a second locally acquired clade 1 case in Los Angeles County) [https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1978923331198861760] [https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1979246526972023091]; a locally acquired chikungunya case in New York State (first in US in six years) [https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1978554168458535095]. H9N2 human cases in China also appeared in surveillance reports (two new cases) [https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1978185726496837660].\n- Respiratory-season signals and vaccine effectiveness: early and rising seasonal respiratory activity (influenza and RSV in parts of Asia and the Northern Hemisphere), and Southern Hemisphere vaccine effectiveness data showing roughly 50% protection for 2025 ‚Äî a reminder to push vaccination now [https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1979221932861018215]. Multiple jurisdictions (West Coast Alliance) are recommending immunizations for flu, RSV, and COVID-19 for the 2025‚Äì26 season [https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1978467096746168709].\n- Zoonotic outbreaks in Africa and adjacent regions: rising Rift Valley fever counts in Senegal and Mauritania with human and animal deaths reported, plus diphtheria clusters in Mauritania ‚Äî signals of multi-pathogen pressure on fragile health systems [https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1978153347329761556] [https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1979223336132530504].\n- Surveillance and system resilience concerns: major U.S. federal workforce cuts, firing of CDC teams, and the government shutdown interrupted routine public health reporting and surveillance; state and external trackers are stepping in while governors seek alliances to protect public health capacity [https://x.com/statnews/status/1977106351718293768] [https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1979285386837823759].\n- Antimicrobial resistance and One Health: WHO data and reporting highlighted increasing antimicrobial resistance worldwide (1 in 6 common bacterial infections resistant in 2023), underscoring the global AMR risk alongside zoonoses [https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1977837216303878653].\n\nNotable patterns and trends\n- Geographic breadth and cross-species spread of H5N1: last week showed extensive detection in wild migratory birds across many U.S. states, predator birds (hawks, vultures, eagles) that indicate ground-level spread, multiple commercial and backyard poultry outbreaks, and repeated dairy herd infections ‚Äî a pattern of sustained enzootic transmission with repeated spillover into domestic animals and ongoing potential for human exposure [https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1978504989908553901] [https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1978494712538411371].\n- Early and intense seasonal respiratory activity in parts of Asia and the Northern Hemisphere (Japan, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Hefei) and a recommendation to vaccinate early ‚Äî this increases the chances of co-circulation and co-infections (flu + H5 exposures) that complicate clinical management and surveillance [https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1978185266905944316] [https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1978135969111957601].\n- Surveillance gaps magnified by U.S. political and workforce disruptions: the government shutdown and mass layoffs at CDC have led to lost or delayed routine reporting and internal capacity (NHANES, disease-reporting teams), prompting state-level and independent trackers to fill gaps and governors to coordinate regionally [https://x.com/statnews/status/1977097759523037449] [https://x.com/cmyeaton/status/1976987432122761295] [https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1979285386837823759].\n\nImportant mentions, interactions, and data points\n- H5N1 counts and dairy herd data: Idaho reported another infected dairy herd, its 108th, contributing to a total of 1,081 confirmed infected herds in 18 states since spring 2024 (Helen Branswell reporting) [https://x.com/HelenBranswell/status/1979188823549485144]. USDA dairy milk vat surveillance remained unchanged week to week, and affected states listed include California, Idaho, Nevada, Arizona, Nebraska, and Texas [https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1979206647160463629].\n- Specific animal outbreak examples: three large Minnesota turkey farms hit with H5N1 and numerous wild-bird detections across many states, including predator species used as sentinel indicators [https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1979014515048997244] [https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1978504989908553901].\n- Human disease signals: Cambodia reported a pediatric H5N1 human case (a three-year-old girl) ‚Äî an example of persisting zoonotic transmission risk outside North America [https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1978974445206143456]. Two new H9N2 human cases in China were also reported [https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1978185726496837660]. Locally acquired clade 1 mpox cases in Southern California/L.A. County and an earlier Long Beach detection indicate local transmission of a more severe mpox clade in the U.S. [https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1978923331198861760] [https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1979246526972023091]. New York State confirmed a locally acquired chikungunya case, the first U.S. case in six years [https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1978554168458535095].\n- Vaccine and surveillance research/highlights: Southern Hemisphere vaccine effectiveness ~50% (clinic and hospital outcomes) suggests moderate protection but still important public-health benefit [https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1979221932861018215]. WHO/AMR reporting flagged rising antibiotic resistance (1 in 6 common infections resistant), which complicates treatment of secondary bacterial infections and zoonotic bacterial threats [https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1977837216303878653].\n\nSignificant events or announcements (each in one paragraph)\n- Widespread H5N1 animal outbreaks and dairy herd involvement: The H5N1 situation continues to escalate geographically and by host range ‚Äî wild migratory birds, predators, multiple commercial poultry farms (including large turkey farms in Minnesota), backyard flocks, and dairy herds have been detected positive across many U.S. states and internationally. The repeated detection in dairy herds (Idaho‚Äôs recent report was its 108th dairy herd) and the USDA‚Äôs ongoing milk vat surveillance program keep this as a high-priority One Health concern because of occupational exposure risks and potential, though still low, human spillover risk [https://x.com/HelenBranswell/status/1979188823549485144] [https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1978916875552563450] [https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1979014515048997244].\n- Locally acquired clade 1 mpox and other locally transmitted arboviral infections: The U.S. detected locally acquired clade 1 mpox infections in California (first such locally acquired clade 1 case nationally) and a second locally acquired clade 1 case in Los Angeles County, signaling local transmission of a more virulent clade in at least two Southern California jurisdictions; Long Beach and LA events are closely monitored for onward chains [https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1978923331198861760] [https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1979246526972023091]. Separately, New York State‚Äôs confirmation of locally acquired chikungunya highlights risk for Aedes-transmitted diseases re-establishing local chains in temperate areas [https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1978554168458535095].\n- Disruption to U.S. federal surveillance capacity and political impacts on public health: Mass firings and cuts at CDC tied to the government shutdown substantially disrupted routine national surveillance and reporting systems (NHANES and other surveillance teams were affected), prompting coverage by STAT and other outlets and spurring states and external groups to backfill reporting; governors are moving to create alliances to protect public health functions while federal capacity is in flux [https://x.com/statnews/status/1977106351718293768] [https://x.com/statnews/status/1977097759523037449] [https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1979285386837823759]. This is a major systemic risk because timely national surveillance underpins early detection and response to emerging biorisks.\n\nOverall assessment and near-term outlook\n- Risk picture: Zoonotic and vectorborne risks remain elevated this week. H5N1 remains the single largest near-term animal-to-human biorisk because of its wide geographic and host spread; the cluster of locally acquired clade 1 mpox cases, locally acquired chikungunya, and human H9N2/H5N1 detections elsewhere underscore the continuing potential for unpredictable human spillovers. Early respiratory season activity increases the chance of overlapping outbreaks and complicates clinical management and diagnostics.\n- System vulnerability: Surveillance and reporting gaps in the U.S. caused by federal workforce disruptions magnify risk by creating blind spots for detection and situational awareness; state alliances and independent trackers are mitigating but do not replace national capacity.\n\nWhat to watch next (priority signals)\n- New human H5/H9 cases or clusters; any evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission.\n- Expansion of H5N1 into new animal sectors or regions, and updates from USDA milk/dairy surveillance and PAHO regarding human risk [https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1979206647160463629] [https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1978916875552563450].\n- Additional locally acquired mpox or chikungunya cases outside the currently affected counties and vector control responses.\n- Further reporting on CDC staffing, federal surveillance restoration, and coordination steps by governors or states [https://x.com/statnews/status/1977106351718293768] [https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1979285386837823759].\n\nSelected source tweets (examples cited above)\n- Idaho dairy herd / overall herd tally: https://x.com/HelenBranswell/status/1979188823549485144\n- USDA dairy vat surveillance / affected states: https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1979206647160463629\n- Dozens of new avian-flu wild-bird detections and PAHO human case note: https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1978916875552563450\n- Three large turkey farms in Minnesota hit with H5N1: https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1979014515048997244\n- Cambodia pediatric H5N1 case: https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1978974445206143456\n- Two new H9N2 human cases in China: https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1978185726496837660\n- First locally acquired U.S. clade 1 mpox in California: https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1978923331198861760\n- L.A.
