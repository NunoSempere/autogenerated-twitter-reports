It was my Great Honor to win North Carolina six times, including Primaries, in 2016, 2020, and 2024, and this new Map would give the fantastic people of North Carolina the opportunity to elect an additional MAGA Republican in the 2026 Midterm Elections, which would be A HUGE VICTORY for our America First Agenda, not just in North Carolina, but across our Nation. Remember, I won the Electoral College, 312-226, Counties Nationwide, 2,700 to 525, all seven Swing States (A LANDSLIDE!), and now I have the best Polling Numbers I've ever had. Our Party has never been more UNITED, and we are getting so much done for the American People because of it. Therefore, I encourage all of my Republican friends in the North Carolina Legislature to work as hard as they can to pass this new Map so that we can continue our incredible Record of SUCCESS. It is wonderful to see Republicans in \"The Tar Heel State\" standing up to Save our Country and, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. THANK YOU NORTH CAROLINA — MAGA2026!",

President Putin congratulated me and the United States on the Great Accomplishment of Peace in the Middle East, something that, he said, has been dreamed of for centuries. I actually believe that the Success in the Middle East will help in our negotiation in attaining an end to the War with Russia/Ukraine. President Putin thanked the First Lady, Melania, for her involvement with children. He was very appreciative, and said that this will continue. We also spent a great deal of time talking about Trade between Russia and the United States when the War with Ukraine is over. At the conclusion of the call, we agreed that there will be a meeting of our High Level Advisors, next week. The United States' initial meetings will be led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, together with various other people, to be designated. A meeting location is to be determined. President Putin and I will then meet in an agreed upon location, Budapest, Hungary, to see if we can bring this \"inglorious\" War, between Russia and Ukraine, to an end. President Zelenskyy and I will be meeting tomorrow, in the Oval Office, where we will discuss my conversation with President Putin, and much more. I believe great progress was made with today's telephone conversation.",

Trump just signed an order directing the Secretary of War to ensure active-duty U.S. military personnel receive their paychecks on October 15th despite the Democrat Shutdown.\n\nHere is the text of the order:\n\nSUBJECT: Use of Available Department of War Funds for Military Pay and Allowances during the Lapse in Annual Appropriations\n\nThe current appropriations lapse, which includes a lapse in the annual appropriations that the Congress provides for the pay and allowances of military personnel, is now in its fifteenth day. Further, congressional leaders have indicated that political negotiations have stalemated and that the passage of the necessary bipartisan legislation to end the lapse is unlikely to occur before our active duty military personnel are scheduled to receive their next paychecks on October 15th.  This potential outcome presents a serious and unacceptable threat to military readiness and the ability of our Armed Forces to protect and defend our Nation.\n\nAccordingly, as the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States under Article 2 of the United States Constitution, I direct the Secretary of War, in coordination with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, to use for the purpose of pay and allowances any funds appropriated by the Congress that remain available for expenditure in Fiscal Year 2026 to accomplish the scheduled disbursement of military pay and allowances for active duty military personnel, as well as for Reserve component military personnel who have performed active service during the relevant pay period. Funds used for military pay and allowances during the current lapse should be those that the Secretary of War determines are provided for purposes that have a reasonable, logical relationship to the pay and allowances of military personnel, consistent with applicable law, including 31 U.S.C. 1301(a).\n\nAt the conclusion of the current lapse in appropriations, every effort should be made, as authorized by law, to adjust applicable funding accounts within the Department of War to ensure the continuation of Department of War operations and activities consistent with planned expenditures prior to the lapse.\n\nDONALD J. TRUMP",

Trump just signed a Proclamation declaring today, October 14, 2025 — on what would be Charlie Kirk's 32nd birthday — as a \"National Day of Remembrance for Charlie Kirk.\"\n\nHere is the text of the Proclamation:\n\nOn the afternoon of Wednesday, September 10, 2025, pure evil struck when the legendary Charlie Kirk was assassinated in broad daylight in a campus courtyard, triggering a groundswell of righteous fury all across our land. Today, our Nation honors the immortal memory of Charlie -- a father, a husband, a Christian martyr, and a titan of the American conservative movement. We honor his life, we send our condolences to his beautiful family, and we pledge to advance the values for which he laid down his life.\n\nEvery day, Charlie devoted himself to a set of simple causes:  Defending the truth, encouraging debate, and spreading the Gospel of Jesus Christ. He was gracious and articulate beyond measure, always welcomed opposing perspectives, and never deviated from his noble goal of bridging our political, cultural, and philosophical divides.\n\nAs we mourn this extraordinary loss, my Administration will continue to do everything in its power to end this devastating wave of political violence. No civilized country can endure a culture where open debate is met with gunfire, the pursuit of truth is met with bloodshed, and love of country is met with seething hatred. In Charlie's absence, we are now tasked with continuing his mission of giving voice to our cherished American ideals with confidence and clarity. Like him, we must not flinch in the face of darkness and hostility -- and we must never waver in speaking the truth with joyful and steadfast resolve.\n\nToday, on what would have been his 32nd birthday, our Nation honors the loving memory of Charlie Kirk. We offer our condolences to his beautiful wife, Erika, and two precious children. We call on every American to pray for peace in our public square. Above all, we renew our resolve to always defend our principles of truth, faith, and the open exchange of ideas.\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 14, 2025, as a National Day of Remembrance for Charlie Kirk. I call on the American people to assemble on this day in their respective places of worship, there to pay homage to Charlie's memory. I invite the people of our Nation to pray for the advancement of peace, truth, and justice all across our country.\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fiftieth.\n\nDONALD J.

      "summary": "Short answer — What the White House is doing this week:\nThe White House is running a heavy mix of international diplomacy (a major Middle East peace push and active Ukraine diplomacy), domestic policy rollouts on fertility/IVF and energy, aggressive immigration and law‑enforcement actions, crisis management around the ongoing government shutdown (including executive steps to protect pay for troops and certain law‑enforcement pay), and targeted national‑security operations (including kinetic strikes on narcotics traffickers). Key themes across the week are: portraying major diplomatic wins, emphasizing law-and-order and border enforcement, using executive authority to bypass Congressional gridlock, and promoting domestic economic/energy gains.\n\nMajor developments (each significant item in one paragraph):\n1) Gaza / Middle East peace summit and hostage returns — signature item: This week the White House led and celebrated a high‑profile Gaza Peace deal and international summit (presidential addresses, meetings with world leaders, signing ceremony) that the administration frames as ending the Gaza war and securing the release of hostages. The White House pushed this as a historic diplomatic achievement, repeatedly posting highlights of the summit, the signing of the Gaza Peace Plan, and the claim that all remaining living hostages were freed (see e.g. \"PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST\" coverage and signing posts) [https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1977813298432364677; https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1977776820435992751]. The administration amplified global praise and used the event to underline U.S. leadership and momentum for follow‑on reconstruction and demilitarization steps.\n\n2) Ukraine diplomacy / Russia outreach — high‑level contacts and summit planning: The White House hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and emphasized active trilateral diplomacy with Russia. The President met with Zelensky at the White House and held a bilateral lunch, and also described productive telephone conversations with President Putin and the intention to convene high‑level advisor meetings — and ultimately a possible President‑to‑President meeting — aimed at ending the Russia‑Ukraine war or moving toward a negotiated pause/settlement [https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1979258594072682842; https://x.com/trump_repost/status/1978872484960301387]. Messaging framed any progress as saving lives and limiting U.S. cost/exposure while urging Europe and NATO to shoulder responsibilities.\n\n3) IVF and fertility access package — domestic policy rollout: The administration announced a package of executive actions and public–private deals to reduce IVF and fertility drug costs and expand access (including a fact sheet and a pharmaceutical discount announcement from EMD Serono), plus steps to allow supplemental fertility insurance for employers — positioned as a ‘‘historic victory for American women, mothers, and families’’ [https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1978949314618577148; https://x.com/PressSec/status/1978931596582391857]. Officials touted concrete discounts (public statements include an 84% discount claim) and projected coverage expansions for hundreds of thousands to nearly a million families.\n\n4) Government shutdown response — troops and law enforcement paid via executive moves: With a continuing appropriations lapse, the administration has used executive orders and agency actions to ensure military pay and targeted law‑enforcement pay despite the shutdown. The President signed an order directing the Secretary of War to use available Department funds to guarantee military pay; DHS leadership and the White House repeatedly emphasized that DHS law enforcement and 70,000+ sworn officers will be paid (including “super checks”) even as the White House blamed Democrats for the shutdown and warned of SNAP/HMGP impacts [https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1978532265652105484; https://x.com/Sec_Noem/status/1979208344175812846]. Messaging repeatedly casts the administration as protecting essential workers while accusing Democrats of political theater.\n\nOther notable themes, patterns and data points:\n- Law enforcement, immigration, and border security are front and center: frequent DHS/ICE posts about arrests, deportations, operations (Operation Pacific Viper, Operation Midway Blitz), and public claims of tens of thousands of criminal removals and violent‑crime arrests (the White House cited \"over 23,000 violent criminals\" arrested by the FBI) are used to underscore a ‘‘law-and-order’’ agenda and justify tougher immigration enforcement [https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1978228833372250415; https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1978626563865215201]. The White House also repeatedly posted deportation announcements and framed sanctuary jurisdictions as dangerous.\n\n- National‑security and kinetic action: The administration publicly announced a strike on a narcotics‑trafficking vessel in international waters (USSOUTHCOM area) that killed six narcoterrorists — the White House highlighted this as part of counter‑narcotics and maritime security operations [https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1978165208225894678]. Related DHS posts emphasize cartel threats against agents and higher assault rates on ICE officers.\n\n- Energy and economic messaging: The White House and Energy Dept. pushed a pro‑domestic‑production energy narrative — celebrating record oil pumping, falling gas prices and investments (GE Aerospace, Stellantis, First Solar), and promoting fusion R&D — while opposing a proposed global carbon tax at the IMO [https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1979278808810152025; https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1979214799532691676; https://x.com/trump_repost/status/1978895112039207284].\n\n- Domestic politics and communications pattern: The White House’s social feed this week mixes celebration of diplomatic wins and economic wins with sharp partisan attacks — blaming Democrats (Schumer) for the shutdown, attacking media and opponents, and promoting executive actions as necessary remedies. There is heavy amplification from RapidResponse/Twitter accounts and retweets of allied officials to shape a narrative of accomplishments and contrasts with the opposition.\n\nImportant interactions, spokespeople, and mentions to note:\n- High‑level foreign leaders visited or engaged: Presidents Zelenskyy (Ukraine), Javier Milei (Argentina), and summit leaders from Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey were prominent in diplomacy posts [https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1979241053019672994; https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1978157866176466961; https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1977776820435992751].\n- Senior Cabinet and agency officials were active in messaging: DHS Secretary Noem, Sec. Rubio (State/Treasury messaging), Sec. Wright (Energy), Sec. War/Defense posts, AG Pam Bondi and Treasury Sec. Scott Bessent were repeatedly quoted and retweeted on enforcement, peace, and economic themes.\n- Domestic honors/ceremonies: The White House held a Presidential Medal of Freedom ceremony posthumously honoring Charlie Kirk and issued a National Day of Remembrance proclamation — used to advance a law‑and‑order and anti‑political‑violence narrative [https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1978206858453106714; https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1978199626625978373].\n\nNotable factual claims and figures the White House emphasized this week (as presented in tweets):\n- ‘‘8 wars ended in 8 months’’ / major Middle East peace claim; repeated hostages freed / \"all remaining living hostages\" rhetoric [https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1978195243775262981].\n- FBI arrested \"over 23,000 violent criminals\" since the Administration began focusing on violent crime enforcement [https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1978626563865215201].\n- DHS claims (under Sec. Noem) of $13.2 billion saved in first 7 months and ~ $50 million saved per day since Jan 25, 2025 (administration figures) [https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1979276379570004219].\n- EMD Serono announced deep discounts (public quotes referenced an 84% discount) on fertility drugs as part of the IVF initiative [https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1978917941778268207].\n\nBottom line / Outlook for the rest of the week:\nExpect the White House to continue to: (1) lean into and publicize the Middle East peace summit as a signature foreign‑policy win and use it to build momentum on reconstruction/demilitarization; (2) press Ukraine/Russia diplomacy actions (follow‑on advisor meetings and a possible summit); (3) keep promoting domestic cost‑of‑living wins (IVF discounts, lower gas prices, manufacturing investments) while pursuing hardline immigration and law‑enforcement enforcement narratives; and (4) use executive authority and public relations to blunt political damage from the government shutdown (guaranteeing pay for military and some law enforcement, attacking Democratic leaders, and prioritizing operational continuity). \n\nSelected source tweets cited above:\n- Gaza Peace / Summit and hostages: https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1977813298432364677 and https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1977776820435992751\n- Zelenskyy meetings: https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1979258594072682842 and https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1979239675282784660\n- Putin phone call / advisor meetings: https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1978844711990288393 and https://x.com/trump_repost/status/1978872484960301387\n- IVF/fertility actions: https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1978949314618577148 and https://x.com/PressSec/status/1978931596582391857\n- Troop pay executive action: https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1978532265652105484\n- DHS / law enforcement and deportations: https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1978985754148671647 and https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1978228833372250415\n- Kinetic strike on narcotics vessel: https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1978165208225894678\n- Charlie Kirk Medal of Freedom / Proclamation: https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1978206858453106714 and https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1978199626625978373\n\nIf you want, I can (a) produce a one‑paragraph brief you could use as a press outlet lead, (b) extract only domestic policy items with links for staffers, or (c) produce a timeline of this week’s events with timestamps and the primary source tweet for each entry."
