Significant events or developments (each summarized in a paragraph)
1) Federal Reserve decision, internal splits, and market reaction
The Fed cut rates by 25 basis points this week, a move accompanied by visible dissents and heavy market scrutiny. Coverage emphasized a broader internal debate over reserve management, balance-sheet policy, and whether the Fed has signaled too much or too little about future cuts. Officials such as Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan publicly defended the ample‑reserves regime, while Kansas City Fed President Jeff Schmid dissented, arguing policy should lean against demand with inflation still too high [Fed cut & vote](https://x.com/unusual_whales/status/1984062262747742628), [Lorie Logan defense](https://x.com/NickTimiraos/status/1984309885522084290), [Schmid dissent](https://x.com/business/status/1984239158689190166). Markets parsed the decision via Treasury yields, mortgage‑rate movement and repo rate oddities, heightening volatility and policy debate [repo above fed range](https://x.com/elerianm/status/1984293638705131905), [mortgage rates jump](https://x.com/CNBC/status/1983958110650683876).

2) Trump–Xi summit and one‑year trade truce
A high‑profile meeting between US President Donald Trump and China’s Xi Jinping produced a one‑year truce on tariffs and some export-control friction, plus near-term purchases of US agricultural goods. The agreement eased immediate trade tensions and lifted asset prices in some sectors, but analysts and outlets warned the truce leaves many structural questions unresolved and could be renegotiated year to year, creating persistent uncertainty [Trump–Xi truce coverage](https://x.com/business/status/1983975858474725403), [China soy purchases post-talks](https://x.com/business/status/1984111254881870329), [commentary on supply chains](https://x.com/business/status/1984089133413744731).

3) Government shutdown, SNAP rulings, and household stress
The continuing US government shutdown produced immediate social and economic effects. Federal judges found the suspension of SNAP benefits likely unlawful and ordered contingency funds to be used to maintain food assistance, while reporting highlighted the risk that about 42 million Americans could face cuts in benefits if the shutdown persisted. The shutdown also strained other federal operations and raised solvency and liquidity questions for recipients and some contractors [judges order SNAP payments to continue](https://x.com/business/status/1984326315177128394), [42 million at risk story](https://x.com/business/status/1984244669815914956), [reports on USDA contingency funds](https://x.com/SpencerHakimian/status/1984282397828145331).

4) AI and mega‑corporate earnings lift markets amid real‑economy stress
Corporate results and deal flow tied to AI dominated headlines: Amazon reported a strong quarter with AWS/cloud momentum that sent its shares sharply higher, while Nvidia-related infrastructure deals and plans (including Samsung’s GPU facility) underscored an ongoing reallocation to AI capex. That drove a market rally concentrated in a few large names even as signs of consumer stress—rising grocery prices, health‑insurance premium increases, underwater car loans—and narrower market breadth persisted [Amazon beat & surge](https://x.com/unusual_whales/status/1983987985743012284), [AWS analysis](https://x.com/CNBC/status/1983991342456868905), [Samsung GPU facility](https://x.com/unusual_whales/status/1984218039412486584), [grocery inflation & consumer pressure](https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1984268764414631994).

5) Money-market and banking signals: reserves, M2, and credit strains
This week exposed friction in money markets and signs of balance-sheet stress. US bank reserves fell to the lowest level since 2020, repo rates traded unusually above policy targets at times, and reports flagged large unrealized losses on banks’ books and strains in private credit markets. At the same time, M2 money supply showed a record monthly/annual rise, which complicates the inflation and liquidity picture for policy makers [bank reserves $2.8T](https://x.com/Barchart/status/1984321872763236541), [repo above fed range](https://x.com/elerianm/status/1984293638705131905), [unrealized bank losses $395B](https://x.com/Barchart/status/1984067074495541608), [M2 +4.5% YoY record](https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1984324909221523547).

Bottom line
This week was heavy on policy and structural storylines: a fractious Fed decision and internal reorganization, a geopolitically consequential Trump–Xi truce that eased near-term trade frictions, a damaging and politically charged US government shutdown with immediate social‑safety‑net consequences, and markets driven higher by AI earnings and deal flow even as liquidity indicators and real‑economy strains raised caution flags. Key follow-ups for the coming days include Fed minutes and commentary, developments on the shutdown and SNAP funding, China macro and property data, OPEC+ decisions, and how AI capex narratives translate into broader economic growth.
