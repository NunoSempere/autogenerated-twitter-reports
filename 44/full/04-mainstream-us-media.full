No, that's not right.”\n\nVance was responding to a question from an audience member during the Q&A portion of the event at the University of Mississippi. \n\nLater in the exchange, Vance addressed a portion of the question about the number of immigrants the U.S. should accept. \n \n“Right now, the answer is far less than we've been accepting,” the vice president said. “We have got to become a common community again, and you can't do that when you have such high numbers of immigration, which is one of the reasons why we have the immigration policy we do.” \n\nHe also argued that for decades after the U.S. enacted strict immigration limits in the 1920s, the immigrants who were already in the United States “assimilated into American culture, and there was an expectation that they would assimilate into American culture.”",

      "summary": "Top-line answer — the most important events this week:\n1) U.S. government shutdown fallout escalated as courts ordered access to backup funds to keep some SNAP (food stamp) benefits flowing, while states and grocers mobilized emergency measures for millions at risk. [CNN judge ruling](https://x.com/CNN/status/1984334173361078621)  \n2) President Trump pushed major, disruptive policy moves — urging Senate Republicans to scrap the filibuster and announcing an immediate resumption of U.S. nuclear testing — prompting confusion and alarm across Washington and among allies. [Trump on nuclear testing and filibuster](https://x.com/FoxNews/status/1984332222447731039)  \n3) King Charles stripped Prince Andrew of royal titles and ordered him to leave Royal Lodge, a major royal-family development that dominated UK coverage. [Buckingham Palace announcement](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1983978429969265006)  \n4) Hurricane Melissa battered the Caribbean — especially Jamaica — causing dozens of deaths, major infrastructure damage and multi-country relief and evacuation efforts. [Hurricane Melissa reporting](https://x.com/ABC/status/1983963490034262267)  \n5) Big tech and AI moves dominated markets and business news: strong earnings from Apple and Amazon, big AI and data‑center spending plans, surging demand for storage and AI chips (benefitting vendors and suppliers). [Reuters on AI-driven demand and stock moves](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1984327130038124944)\n6) Security news: the FBI announced arrests after thwarting an alleged planned violent/terrorist attack in Michigan; U.S. military strikes and classified briefings on drug-smuggling strikes drew congressional criticism. [FBI thwarted attack](https://x.com/ABC/status/1984230434645975457)  \n\nDetailed paragraphs on the biggest developments (each significant event summarized):\n- Government shutdown, SNAP and court orders: As the shutdown extended into its fourth week, courts and multiple judges pushed back on the administration’s attempts to suspend food aid — ordering the use of contingency funds to cover at least part of November SNAP benefits and raising the prospect that millions would not immediately lose aid. States and cities declared emergency measures (food‑bank funding, National Guard help at food banks) as grocers and supply chains braced for lower November sales if benefits lapsed. The rulings and emergency actions were widely reported and prompted both legal and political fights in Washington. [CNN: federal judges order emergency funds be used](https://x.com/CNN/status/1984334173361078621) | [Washington Post: ordered to release funds](https://x.com/washingtonpost/status/1984331046922371221)  \n\n- Trump’s calls to “go nuclear” on the Senate filibuster and his nuclear‑testing announcement: President Trump urged Republicans to eliminate the Senate filibuster to pass funding and repeatedly signaled the U.S. would resume nuclear testing “soon.” The statements created significant policy shock and uncertainty — legal, technical and diplomatic experts questioned feasibility and risks, and lawmakers (including some Republicans) publicly pushed back. The comments also fed market and allied concerns about arms‑race dynamics. [Fox News coverage of Trump’s nuclear/testing comments](https://x.com/FoxNews/status/1984332222447731039) | [Reuters on confusion and concern](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1984313210443342218)  \n\n- Royal fallout: Prince Andrew stripped of titles and residence: Buckingham Palace moved to remove Prince Andrew’s princely style, honors and Windsor residence amid continuing fallout from his association with Jeffrey Epstein and renewed public scrutiny. The action was widely covered and triggered domestic debate about accountability and the monarchy’s handling of scandal. [Reuters: palace action to strip Andrew](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1983978429969265006)  \n\n- Hurricane Melissa and Caribbean impact: Melissa struck as a powerful storm, producing widespread destruction across Jamaica, Cuba, Haiti and nearby islands, with confirmed multiple‑dozen fatalities, damaged hospitals, fuel shortages and large-scale relief requirements. Governments and aid groups rushed supplies and rescue efforts; displaced and stranded tourists and residents faced continuing uncertainty. [ABC: Melissa aftermath and death toll coverage](https://x.com/ABC/status/1983963490034262267) | [Reuters: death toll updates](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1984187389921685938)  \n\n- AI, big tech earnings and hardware demand spike: Apple and Amazon reported stronger-than-expected results, helping markets; major tech firms announced large investments in AI and data center capacity. This week also saw rising demand for data‑storage technologies and AI chips (benefitting suppliers and prompting large chip orders), reinforcing a theme of AI-driven capital spending reshaping markets. [Reuters: Western Digital/Seagate surge on AI demand](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1984327130038124944) | [Reuters: Apple/Amazon earnings lift markets](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1984246476915331093)  \n\n- Security and justice events: The FBI said it prevented an alleged plot tied to a potential violent/terrorist attack in Michigan and arrested multiple suspects; separate developments included contested DOJ and Pentagon actions (U.S. strikes on suspected drug‑smuggling boats and disputes over classified briefings that excluded Democrats). Those events produced bipartisan concern about oversight and civil‑liberties implications. [ABC on FBI arrests in Michigan](https://x.com/ABC/status/1984230434645975457) | [NewsHour on excluded Democrats and briefings](https://x.com/NewsHour/status/1984087939387662673)\n\nOther notable stories, trends and data points:\n- Political and governance patterns: high partisan tension and brinkmanship (shutdown dynamics, filibuster fight), public frustration (polls showing half of Americans blaming Trump/GOP for shutdown), and growing pressure from unions, businesses and airlines warning of disruptions if the shutdown persisted. [Axios: almost half blame Trump/GOP](https://x.com/Axios/status/1983995351141916699)  \n- Food assistance scale: reporting repeatedly cited roughly 41–42 million Americans at risk of SNAP disruptions, prompting state-level emergency funding and food‑bank mobilization. [Washington Post on 42M at risk](https://x.com/washingtonpost/status/1984259446839676956) | [Reuters on state emergency steps](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1984021243377676457)  \n- Disruptive weather and infrastructure stress: heavy rains and flash floods in New York City caused deaths, subway/street flooding and hundreds of flight disruptions; airports also faced compounding staffing shortages related to the shutdown. [Reuters on NYC heavy rain and deaths](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1984142046198677633)  \n- Global geopolitics: the Trump‑Xi APEC exchanges and a limited trade truce captured attention — markets and policymakers flagged shifts in export restrictions and diplomatic engagement with China. [Reuters on Trump‑Xi talks and truce](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1984231428117110871)  \n- Legal and criminal stories: high‑profile prosecutions, arrests and investigations kept appearing (Louvre heist suspects, police raids in Rio, Prince Andrew action, Diddy transfer), often prompting large media cycles. [Reuters on Rio police raids fatalities](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1983980227857367168)  \n\nNotable patterns and trends across the week:\n- Convergence of politics and operational disruption: Political deadlock at the federal level produced tangible service and market effects (air travel, SNAP, federal pay, airport staffing), increasing pressure on both parties to find near-term fixes.  \n- Intensifying AI/tech investment juxtaposed with market volatility: companies announced big AI-related capital outlays even as investors watched margins, bond sales and spending closely — boosting chip, storage and cloud stocks while stoking commentary about an AI investment cycle.  \n- Weather/climate extremes producing humanitarian crises: Hurricane Melissa and regional flooding underscored continuing climate disaster responses and cross-border humanitarian needs.  \n- Elevated national‑security posture and opaque operations: more military and law‑enforcement actions (strikes, classified briefings) surfaced this week, triggering questions about oversight, partisan access and civilian impacts.\n\nQuick list of primary sources (representative tweets from the collection):\n- SNAP/fund release and shutdown: [CNN federal judges order funds](https://x.com/CNN/status/1984334173361078621) | [Washington Post coverage](https://x.com/washingtonpost/status/1984331046922371221)\n- Trump nuclear testing / filibuster demand: [Fox News clip of Trump testing comment](https://x.com/FoxNews/status/1984332222447731039) | [Reuters analysis](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1984313210443342218)\n- Prince Andrew stripped: [Reuters on palace action](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1983978429969265006)\n- Hurricane Melissa: [ABC coverage](https://x.com/ABC/status/1983963490034262267) | [Reuters death toll updates](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1984187389921685938)\n- AI/tech and markets: [Reuters on storage stocks/AI demand](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1984327130038124944) | [Reuters on Apple/Amazon earnings](https://x.com/Reuters/status/1984246476915331093)\n- FBI thwarted attack: [ABC report on arrests](https://x.com/ABC/status/1984230434645975457)\n\nBottom line: the week was dominated by a mix of acute domestic governance crises (shutdown, SNAP risk), high‑impact foreign policy and security moves (nuclear‑testing pronouncements, military strikes and classified briefings), a major royal scandal escalation in the U.K., deadly weather disasters in the Caribbean, and a continuing AI/tech investment wave reshaping markets. Each of those storylines carries near‑term operational consequences (food access, travel, markets, humanitarian needs) and medium‑term political and diplomatic implications."
