A new review characterizes clinical uncertainty and shows how teachers can guide learners to recognize, manage, and communicate uncertainty in practice. \n\nFigure 1 from the review shows a conceptual model of how clinicians manage clinical uncertainty. \n\nClinicians recognize uncertainty through a range of cognitive, somatic, emotional, and behavioral cues and manage these experiences over time through cyclic processes of forward planning and monitoring, which can, in turn, reveal new uncertainties. These processes are highly dynamic and are shaped by evolving clinical findings and contexts. \n\nLearn more in the Review Article “Educational Strategies to Prepare Trainees for Clinical Uncertainty,” the latest in the Medical Education series, by Jonathan S.

In 2013, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommended lung cancer screening (LCS) using annual low-dose computed tomography to screen high-risk individuals. More than a decade later, the implementation of national screening recommendations remains poor, with fewer than 1 in 5 eligible patients in the United States receiving LCS.  \n\nThe authors developed and implemented a comprehensive LCS program structured around a broad evidence-based approach, including the following:  \n\n• Educational outreach to practices \n• Population health initiatives integrated into primary care \n• A coordinated recall process to ensure follow-up for annual screening and abnormal results \n• A centralized program to supplement screening and provide consultative support. \n\nThe authors found that a well-coordinated LCS program built on a shared population health infrastructure can elevate LCS rates to levels comparable to other established cancer screening programs, such as those for breast and colon cancer. \n\nRead the Case Study “A Comprehensive, Multidisciplinary Approach to Improving Lung Cancer Screening” by R.J.

Examination under light microscopy revealed 13 glomeruli, 15% of which were globally sclerosed, and mild tubular atrophy with interstitial fibrosis involving 15% of the cortex. Further inspection of the glomeruli showed mesangial expansion and capillary walls thickened by a nonargyrophilic, amorphous material, amyloid, which was mildly positive on periodic acid–Schiff staining and pale blue on Masson’s trichrome staining. Subsequently, on Congo red staining, the mesangial and vessel wall material was salmon-pink under standard light microscopy with apple-green birefringence under polarized light. \n\nRead the full case details in “An 82-Year-Old Woman with Abdominal Distention, Edema, and Pleural Effusion,” a Case Record of the Massachusetts General Hospital, by Z.

      "summarization_question": "Summarize biorisk news last week",
      "summary": "Direct answer\nLast week’s biorisk headlines were dominated by a large, multi-country resurgence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) with several mammalian detections; ongoing mpox surveillance and targeted vaccination efforts; significant Rift Valley fever activity in West Africa; growing measles clusters (threatening elimination in some places); and multiple studies and program updates on COVID/long-COVID, vaccine safety/efficacy, and novel coronaviruses. Other notable items included foodborne/Listeria and drug-recall stories and a pause in some gene‑editing trials.\n\nKey themes and topics\n- Avian influenza (H5N1): widespread detections across wild birds and commercial/backyard poultry in North America and Europe, with authorities reporting infected predator and scavenger species, farm quarantines, import restrictions, and unusual mass die-offs of cranes in France. Mammalian detections (house mice in Washington, tigers in Vietnam) and viral mutations associated with mammalian adaptation increased concern about mammalian spillover and pandemic risk.

Government actions (quarantines, housing orders, import suspensions) and cross-border trade restrictions were repeatedly reported (examples: UK commercial outbreak https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1983998136554234296; Canada/BC multiple outbreaks https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1982868649468932460; France crane die-offs https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1983995876709429458).\n- Spillover into mammals is increasingly documented and concerning: house mice testing positive in Grant County, Washington (linked to a large poultry infection) and findings of H5N1 in captive/wild mammals (tigers in Vietnam) — plus reports of mutations linked to mammalian adaptation — are pattern signals that demand closer One Health surveillance (WA mice: https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1983551744971014439; tiger deaths: https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1983516888123453849).\n- Vaccine/respiratory protection evidence is accumulating while pockets of low vaccination sustain outbreaks: large evidence syntheses support continuing use of COVID/flu/RSV vaccines to prevent severe disease, yet measles clusters—often in undervaccinated communities—are growing (NEJM/CIDRAP vaccine syntheses: https://x.com/NEJM/status/1983643775206609045; measles spread: https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1982915994034053543).\n- Public health systems stressors: concurrent emergencies (avian flu, cholera, Rift Valley fever, measles, mpox) and operational interruptions (surveillance data outages, funding constraints) are creating fragility and complicating timely situational awareness and response.\n\nImportant mentions, interactions, and data points\n- WHO cholera burden (Jan–28 Sep 2025): >518,000 cases and 6,508 deaths across 32 countries; OCV stockpile briefly rose to ~5.2 million doses in Sept (WHO: https://x.com/WHO/status/1983567910573392262).\n- Mpox September report: 42 countries, 3,135 confirmed cases and 12 deaths; WHO & technical leads emphasize targeted detection, treatment, contact tracing and vaccination of high‑risk groups (mvankerkhove: https://x.com/mvankerkhove/status/1984298776236847472; WHO summary: https://x.com/WHO/status/1984285311518527930).\n- Rift Valley fever in Senegal and Mauritania: hundreds of confirmed human cases reported (WHO/FluTrackers coverage: https://x.com/WHO/status/1984199067535077868; https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1983266993571512795).\n- H5N1 specifics and mammal detections: house mice (Grant County, WA) with H5N1 alongside wild bird and large commercial poultry infections (https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1983551744971014439; https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1983980353732681879). Mass crane die-offs in France and multiple new poultry farm outbreaks across Europe and North America were widely reported (France cranes: https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1983995876709429458; multiple EU outbreaks: https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1983613404603675006).\n- Measles: US outbreaks (South Carolina, Utah, Minnesota), rising Canadian case counts threatening elimination status, and international clusters including Israel (child deaths) and New Zealand school exposures (examples: South Carolina update https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1983651741334995211; Canada/elim threat https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1982915994034053543; Utah probable case https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1983655143699824763).\n- Food safety and product recalls: expanded Listeria outbreak tied to ready‑to‑eat pre‑cooked pasta with at least 27 illnesses and 6 deaths prompting nationwide investigation (https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1984010253793738782); atorvastatin recalls and supply/inspection concerns were reported (https://x.com/ConversationUS/status/1984105211464458601).\n- Research & regulatory signals: Intellia paused two CRISPR trials over liver toxicity concerns (coverage: https://x.com/statnews/status/1983216537960841304); NEJM and CIDRAP highlighted new trial results and vaccine evidence syntheses (NEJM vaccine pieces: https://x.com/NEJM/status/1983643775206609045; CIDRAP vaccine tracker: https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1983943172343447937).\n\nSignificant events (each major development summarized)\n1) H5N1 surge, mammalian detections, and unusual wildlife mortality — high significance\n- What happened: Rapid, widespread detections of H5N1 in wild birds and poultry across North America and Europe were reported, with multiple commercial farm quarantines and culling, import restrictions, and government housing orders. Notably, H5N1 was detected in house mice on a Washington state site linked to a large commercial poultry infection and tigers in Vietnam died with H5N1 bearing mammalian‑adaptation mutations. Experts warned about the virus’ pandemic potential if mammal‑to‑mammal adaptation increases. (See field reports and analysis: WA mice: https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1983551744971014439; review on asymptomatic human H5N1 infections: https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1983978347731304907; France crane die-offs: https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1983995876709429458.)\n- Why it matters: Expanded geographic circulation plus mammalian infections raise One Health concerns about cross‑species transmission, surveillance gaps, and the need for strengthened farm biosecurity, wildlife monitoring, and human surveillance.\n\n2) Mpox status and African vaccination support — medium significance but programmatically important\n- What happened: WHO and technical leads reiterated that clade Ib mpox is low risk for the general population but moderate for men who have sex with men; WHO and partners continue monitoring and response activities. AfricaCDC received and allocated additional Bavarian Nordic vaccine doses to Uganda and launched frameworks to strengthen outbreak preparedness with UKHSA. (WHO mpox update: https://x.com/WHO/status/1984285311518527930; AfricaCDC vaccine news: https://x.com/AfricaCDC/status/1983507525166092689; AfricaCDC/UKHSA framework: https://x.com/AfricaCDC/status/1984163393578696848.)\n- Why it matters: Continued targeted vaccination, early detection, contact tracing and treatment remain essential to control local outbreaks and limit spread.\n\n3) Rift Valley fever in West Africa (Senegal and Mauritania) — significant regional public‑health event\n- What happened: Senegal (and nearby countries) reported hundreds of confirmed Rift Valley fever cases; WHO is supporting surge response and convening R&D consultations. (WHO: https://x.com/WHO/status/1984199067535077868; AfricaCDC reporting.)\n- Why it matters: Rift Valley fever affects human and animal health and livelihoods and requires integrated surveillance, vector control, animal vaccination and clinical care scaling.\n\nOther notable developments (brief)\n- Measles clusters grew in multiple jurisdictions, threatening elimination status in Canada and causing local public health alerts and potential exposures at airports and schools (CIDRAP and FluTrackers: https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1982915994034053543; https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1983038905994600614).\n- Vaccine evidence: large syntheses and NEJM coverage reinforced continuing benefits of COVID/RSV/flu vaccination against severe outcomes (NEJM/CIDRAP: https://x.com/NEJM/status/1983643775206609045; https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1983640624675848583).\n- Surveillance and system stressors: CDC data outages and funding/dependency critiques for WHO highlighted limits to situational awareness and potential governance vulnerabilities (CDC data gap: https://x.com/cmyeaton/status/1982478925927436377; WHO funding critique: https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1983952593224159504).\n\nBottom line\nLast week emphasized the persistent and widening One Health risks from H5N1 (including mammalian spillover signals), continuing hotspots for other zoonotic/vector‑borne threats (Rift Valley fever, cholera, mpox), resurging vaccine‑preventable disease clusters (measles), and ongoing advances in vaccine science and long‑COVID research — all occurring against a backdrop of surveillance and operational stresses that could blunt timely detection and response.
