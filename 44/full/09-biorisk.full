In 2013, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommended lung cancer screening (LCS) using annual low-dose computed tomography to screen high-risk individuals. More than a decade later, the implementation of national screening recommendations remains poor, with fewer than 1 in 5 eligible patients in the United States receiving LCS.  \n\nThe authors developed and implemented a comprehensive LCS program structured around a broad evidence-based approach, including the following:  \n\n‚Ä¢¬†Educational outreach to practices \n‚Ä¢¬†Population health initiatives integrated into primary care \n‚Ä¢¬†A coordinated recall process to ensure follow-up for annual screening and abnormal results \n‚Ä¢ A centralized program to supplement screening and provide consultative support. \n\nThe authors found that a well-coordinated LCS program built on a shared population health infrastructure can elevate LCS rates to levels comparable to other established cancer screening programs, such as those for breast and colon cancer. \n\nRead the Case Study ‚ÄúA Comprehensive, Multidisciplinary Approach to Improving Lung Cancer Screening‚Äù by R.J.

      "summary": "Direct answer\nLast week‚Äôs biorisk headlines were dominated by a large, multi-country resurgence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) with several mammalian detections; ongoing mpox surveillance and targeted vaccination efforts; significant Rift Valley fever activity in West Africa; growing measles clusters (threatening elimination in some places); and multiple studies and program updates on COVID/long-COVID, vaccine safety/efficacy, and novel coronaviruses. Other notable items included foodborne/Listeria and drug-recall stories and a pause in some gene‚Äëediting trials.\n\nKey themes and topics\n- Avian influenza (H5N1): widespread detections across wild birds and commercial/backyard poultry in North America and Europe, with authorities reporting infected predator and scavenger species, farm quarantines, import restrictions, and unusual mass die-offs of cranes in France. Mammalian detections (house mice in Washington, tigers in Vietnam) and viral mutations associated with mammalian adaptation increased concern about mammalian spillover and pandemic risk. See multiple field/country reports and analyses (e.g., US/WA mice confirmation: https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1983551744971014439; review on human H5N1 asymptomatic infections: https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1983978347731304907).\n- Mpox: WHO and technical leads assessed clade Ib mpox risk as low for the general population but moderate for men who have sex with men, while continuing close monitoring; AfricaCDC and partners advanced outbreak response including vaccine allocations (WHO update: https://x.com/WHO/status/1984285311518527930; mvankerkhove thread: https://x.com/mvankerkhove/status/1984298782444446171; AfricaCDC vaccine donation: https://x.com/AfricaCDC/status/1983507525166092689).\n- Rift Valley fever and other vector-borne diseases: Senegal (and parts of West Africa) reported hundreds of Rift Valley fever cases; WHO and AfricaCDC convened research and response actions (WHO alert: https://x.com/WHO/status/1984199067535077868).\n- Vaccine evidence and public-health studies: NEJM/CIDRAP coverage of a Vaccine Integrity Project paper summarizing safety/efficacy of recent COVID, RSV, and flu vaccines; CIDRAP/CEPI launched a tracker for broadly protective coronavirus vaccines; ongoing long-COVID trials launched (trial announcements: https://x.com/EricTopol/status/1984038388559995294; Vaccine Integrity/NEJM: https://x.com/NEJM/status/1983643775206609045; CIDRAP tracker: https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1983943172343447937).\n- Surveillance gaps and programmatic risks: several posts highlighted surveillance and operational impacts ‚Äî interruptions to CDC data flow during the US government shutdown and concerns about WHO funding dependence and effects on independence (CDC data gap: https://x.com/cmyeaton/status/1982478925927436377; WHO funding critique: https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1983952593224159504).\n- Emerging/zoonotic virus science: detection and preprints describing novel betacoronaviruses in neotropical bats and other coronaviral diversity findings raised interest about bat-borne coronavirus evolution (preprints reported: https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1984251779354443836; https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1983926013043052967).\n\nNotable patterns and trends\n- Geographic breadth and frequency of H5N1 events increased: repeated, near‚Äësimultaneous detections in wild birds, commercial poultry and backyard flocks across the US, Canada, many EU countries, and reports of mass mortalities in wild cranes in France signaled a broad circulation peak this season and more frequent farmer/producer impacts. Government actions (quarantines, housing orders, import suspensions) and cross-border trade restrictions were repeatedly reported (examples: UK commercial outbreak https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1983998136554234296; Canada/BC multiple outbreaks https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1982868649468932460; France crane die-offs https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1983995876709429458).\n- Spillover into mammals is increasingly documented and concerning: house mice testing positive in Grant County, Washington (linked to a large poultry infection) and findings of H5N1 in captive/wild mammals (tigers in Vietnam) ‚Äî plus reports of mutations linked to mammalian adaptation ‚Äî are pattern signals that demand closer One Health surveillance (WA mice: https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1983551744971014439; tiger deaths: https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1983516888123453849).\n- Vaccine/respiratory protection evidence is accumulating while pockets of low vaccination sustain outbreaks: large evidence syntheses support continuing use of COVID/flu/RSV vaccines to prevent severe disease, yet measles clusters‚Äîoften in undervaccinated communities‚Äîare growing (NEJM/CIDRAP vaccine syntheses: https://x.com/NEJM/status/1983643775206609045; measles spread: https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1982915994034053543).\n- Public health systems stressors: concurrent emergencies (avian flu, cholera, Rift Valley fever, measles, mpox) and operational interruptions (surveillance data outages, funding constraints) are creating fragility and complicating timely situational awareness and response.\n\nImportant mentions, interactions, and data points\n- WHO cholera burden (Jan‚Äì28 Sep 2025): >518,000 cases and 6,508 deaths across 32 countries; OCV stockpile briefly rose to ~5.2 million doses in Sept (WHO: https://x.com/WHO/status/1983567910573392262).\n- Mpox September report: 42 countries, 3,135 confirmed cases and 12 deaths; WHO & technical leads emphasize targeted detection, treatment, contact tracing and vaccination of high‚Äërisk groups (mvankerkhove: https://x.com/mvankerkhove/status/1984298776236847472; WHO summary: https://x.com/WHO/status/1984285311518527930).\n- Rift Valley fever in Senegal and Mauritania: hundreds of confirmed human cases reported (WHO/FluTrackers coverage: https://x.com/WHO/status/1984199067535077868; https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1983266993571512795).\n- H5N1 specifics and mammal detections: house mice (Grant County, WA) with H5N1 alongside wild bird and large commercial poultry infections (https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1983551744971014439; https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1983980353732681879). Mass crane die-offs in France and multiple new poultry farm outbreaks across Europe and North America were widely reported (France cranes: https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1983995876709429458; multiple EU outbreaks: https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1983613404603675006).\n- Measles: US outbreaks (South Carolina, Utah, Minnesota), rising Canadian case counts threatening elimination status, and international clusters including Israel (child deaths) and New Zealand school exposures (examples: South Carolina update https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1983651741334995211; Canada/elim threat https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1982915994034053543; Utah probable case https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1983655143699824763).\n- Food safety and product recalls: expanded Listeria outbreak tied to ready‚Äëto‚Äëeat pre‚Äëcooked pasta with at least 27 illnesses and 6 deaths prompting nationwide investigation (https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1984010253793738782); atorvastatin recalls and supply/inspection concerns were reported (https://x.com/ConversationUS/status/1984105211464458601).\n- Research & regulatory signals: Intellia paused two CRISPR trials over liver toxicity concerns (coverage: https://x.com/statnews/status/1983216537960841304); NEJM and CIDRAP highlighted new trial results and vaccine evidence syntheses (NEJM vaccine pieces: https://x.com/NEJM/status/1983643775206609045; CIDRAP vaccine tracker: https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1983943172343447937).\n\nSignificant events (each major development summarized)\n1) H5N1 surge, mammalian detections, and unusual wildlife mortality ‚Äî high significance\n- What happened: Rapid, widespread detections of H5N1 in wild birds and poultry across North America and Europe were reported, with multiple commercial farm quarantines and culling, import restrictions, and government housing orders. Notably, H5N1 was detected in house mice on a Washington state site linked to a large commercial poultry infection and tigers in Vietnam died with H5N1 bearing mammalian‚Äëadaptation mutations. Experts warned about the virus‚Äô pandemic potential if mammal‚Äëto‚Äëmammal adaptation increases. (See field reports and analysis: WA mice: https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1983551744971014439; review on asymptomatic human H5N1 infections: https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1983978347731304907; France crane die-offs: https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1983995876709429458.)\n- Why it matters: Expanded geographic circulation plus mammalian infections raise One Health concerns about cross‚Äëspecies transmission, surveillance gaps, and the need for strengthened farm biosecurity, wildlife monitoring, and human surveillance.\n\n2) Mpox status and African vaccination support ‚Äî medium significance but programmatically important\n- What happened: WHO and technical leads reiterated that clade Ib mpox is low risk for the general population but moderate for men who have sex with men; WHO and partners continue monitoring and response activities. AfricaCDC received and allocated additional Bavarian Nordic vaccine doses to Uganda and launched frameworks to strengthen outbreak preparedness with UKHSA. (WHO mpox update: https://x.com/WHO/status/1984285311518527930; AfricaCDC vaccine news: https://x.com/AfricaCDC/status/1983507525166092689; AfricaCDC/UKHSA framework: https://x.com/AfricaCDC/status/1984163393578696848.)\n- Why it matters: Continued targeted vaccination, early detection, contact tracing and treatment remain essential to control local outbreaks and limit spread.\n\n3) Rift Valley fever in West Africa (Senegal and Mauritania) ‚Äî significant regional public‚Äëhealth event\n- What happened: Senegal (and nearby countries) reported hundreds of confirmed Rift Valley fever cases; WHO is supporting surge response and convening R&D consultations. (WHO: https://x.com/WHO/status/1984199067535077868; AfricaCDC reporting.)\n- Why it matters: Rift Valley fever affects human and animal health and livelihoods and requires integrated surveillance, vector control, animal vaccination and clinical care scaling.\n\nOther notable developments (brief)\n- Measles clusters grew in multiple jurisdictions, threatening elimination status in Canada and causing local public health alerts and potential exposures at airports and schools (CIDRAP and FluTrackers: https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1982915994034053543; https://x.com/FluTrackers/status/1983038905994600614).\n- Vaccine evidence: large syntheses and NEJM coverage reinforced continuing benefits of COVID/RSV/flu vaccination against severe outcomes (NEJM/CIDRAP: https://x.com/NEJM/status/1983643775206609045; https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1983640624675848583).\n- Surveillance and system stressors: CDC data outages and funding/dependency critiques for WHO highlighted limits to situational awareness and potential governance vulnerabilities (CDC data gap: https://x.com/cmyeaton/status/1982478925927436377; WHO funding critique: https://x.com/CIDRAP/status/1983952593224159504).\n\nBottom line\nLast week emphasized the persistent and widening One Health risks from H5N1 (including mammalian spillover signals), continuing hotspots for other zoonotic/vector‚Äëborne threats (Rift Valley fever, cholera, mpox), resurging vaccine‚Äëpreventable disease clusters (measles), and ongoing advances in vaccine science and long‚ÄëCOVID research ‚Äî all occurring against a backdrop of surveillance and operational stresses that could blunt timely detection and response.
