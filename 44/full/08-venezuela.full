It was a Great Honor to meet them but, more particularly, to see that America is respected again — RESPECTED LIKE NEVER BEFORE! Great Trade Deals were made, Long Term relationships now exist, and money is pouring into our Country because of Tariffs and, frankly, the Landslide Results of the 2024 Presidential Election. The one question that kept coming up, however, was how did the Democrats SHUT DOWN the United States of America, and why did the powerful Republicans allow them to do it? The fact is, in flying back, I thought a great deal about that question, WHY? Majority Leader John Thune, and Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, are doing a GREAT job, but the Democrats are Crazed Lunatics that have lost all sense of WISDOM and REALITY. It is a sick form of the now “legendary” Trump Derangement Syndrome (TDS) that only comes from losing too much. They want Trillions of Dollars to be taken from our Healthcare System and given to others, who are not deserving — People who have come into our Country illegally, many from prisons and mental institutions. This will hurt American citizens, and Republicans will not let it happen. It is now time for the Republicans to play their “TRUMP CARD,” and go for what is called the Nuclear Option — Get rid of the Filibuster, and get rid of it, NOW! Just a short while ago, the Democrats, while in power, fought for three years to do this, but were unable to pull it off because of Senators Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. Never have the Democrats fought so hard to do something because they knew the tremendous strength that terminating the Filibuster would give them. They want to substantially expand (PACK!) the United States Supreme Court, make Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico States (Thereby automatically picking up 4 Senate seats, many House seats, and at least 8 Electoral Votes!), and many other highly destructive things. Well, now WE are in power, and if we did what we should be doing, it would IMMEDIATELY end this ridiculous, Country destroying “SHUT DOWN.” If the Democrats ever came back into power, which would be made easier for them if the Republicans are not using the Great Strength and Policies made available to us by ending the Filibuster, the Democrats will exercise their rights, and it will be done in the first day they take office, regardless of whether or not we do it. In addition to all of the other things we would get, such as the best Judges, the best U.S. Attorneys, the best of everything, this was a concept from years ago of then President Barack Hussein Obama and former Majority Leader Harry Reid in order to take advantage of the Republicans. Now I want to do it in order to take advantage of the Democrats….\n\n(TS: 30 Oct 22:36 ET)​​​‍​​‌‍​​‌‍​​​​​​‌‍​​​​​‌‍​​​​​​​‌‍​​​​​​​‌‍​​​​​‌‍​​​​​​‌‍​‌‍​​​​​‌‍​​​​​​​​‌‍​​​​​​​‌‍​​​​​‌‍​​​‌‍​​​‌‍​​​‌‍​‌‍",

We agreed on many things, with others, even of high importance, being very close to resolved. I was extremely honored by the fact that President Xi authorized China to begin the purchase of massive amounts of Soybeans, Sorghum, and other Farm products. Our Farmers will be very happy! In fact, as I said once before during my first Administration, Farmers should immediately go out and buy more land and larger tractors. I would like to thank President Xi for this! Additionally, China has agreed to continue the flow of Rare Earth, Critical Minerals, Magnets, etc., openly and freely. Very significantly, China has strongly stated that they will work diligently with us to stop the flow of Fentanyl into our Country. They will help us end the Fentanyl Crisis. China also agreed that they will begin the process of purchasing American Energy. In fact, a very large scale transaction may take place concerning the purchase of Oil and Gas from the Great State of Alaska. Chris Wright, Doug Burgum, and our respective Energy teams will be meeting to see if such an Energy Deal can be worked out. The agreements reached today will deliver Prosperity and Security to millions of Americans. After this Historic trip to Asia, I am now heading back to Washington, D.C. I want to thank the Great Countries of Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea for being so generous, gracious, and hospitable — Also, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam, who were at the Dinner last night hosted by His Excellency Lee Jae Myung. Hundreds of Billions of Dollars are being brought into our Country because of them. Our Nation is Strong, Respected, and Admired Again and, THE BEST IS YET TO COME!",

At the same time, U.S. naval and Marine forces were operating in the nearby Caribbean, Venezuela reported defensive procurement outreach to Russia and China, there were unusual GPS jamming incidents over northern Venezuela and Trinidad & Tobago, and Caracas rolled out domestic surveillance measures.\n\n1) Reports of imminent U.S. strikes vs public denials (significant): Multiple outlets and anonymous U.S. sources were cited this week saying the U.S. government had identified Venezuelan airfields and ports as targets for potential airstrikes intended to degrade military capacity and drug‑trafficking infrastructure; some reports suggested strikes could happen within days or hours [examples: https://x.com/sentdefender/status/1984250342695964762, https://x.com/sentdefender/status/1984080245851365550].

The result this week was a volatile mix of leaking/briefing to media and blunt public denials — a pattern of high-stakes, contradictory messaging.\n\n2) U.S. military posture in the region: U.S. forces visibly increased activity near Venezuela. Southern Command/USMC footage and reporting showed Marines of the 22nd MEU conducting live‑fire small boat exercises in the Caribbean near Venezuela, and the USS Iwo Jima and escort were tracked moving westward near La Orchila — movements highlighted by observers as proximate to Venezuelan territory (footage/report: https://x.com/sentdefender/status/1984070900552192476; ship tracking: https://x.com/SA_Defensa/status/1984036402741526581). These deployments were cited in media pieces suggesting the U.S. had the capacity to strike selected military facilities if policy changed.\n\n3) Unusual GPS interference and other electronic incidents: Analysts reported significant GPS interference and jamming over northern Venezuela’s coast and adjacent Trinidad & Tobago beginning Oct 29, a notable regional navigational/security concern that could affect civil and military operations (report: https://x.com/sentdefender/status/1984308146458767630). The timing and location of the jamming contribute to concerns about escalatory incidents and complicate situational awareness for vessels and aircraft.\n\n4) Venezuela seeks external defensive help; domestic security measures: Reporting said President Nicolás Maduro reportedly reached out to Russia and China for radar overhauls, aircraft repairs and potentially missiles to bolster defenses (washingtonpost-linked tweet: https://x.com/SA_Defensa/status/1984322184441995697). Domestically, Maduro launched a mobile app to encourage citizens to report “everything they see and hear,” a measure framed as strengthening surveillance and control (https://x.com/elpaisinenglish/status/1983866805778075904). These steps show Caracas responding to external pressure with requests for foreign military support and tightening internal monitoring.\n\n5) Additional operational notes and political rhetoric: Media and shadow sources circulated claims that Venezuelan fighter jets (F-16s) were scrambled from El Libertador Air Base to intercept aircraft, indicating heightened airspace activity (https://x.com/sentdefender/status/1983705601382478250). Pro‑opposition voices and pro‑government rhetoric also intensified online (examples: claims Maduro is “ending” or that generals may defect: https://x.com/sentdefender/status/1984325130978541962; https://x.com/sentdefender/status/1984252839628095703).\n\nPatterns and trends: The week’s dominant pattern was a rapid oscillation between leaked media reports of imminent U.S. coercive action and official public denials, producing uncertainty in the region. That uncertainty was accompanied by a visible U.S. military presence, electronic interference incidents (GPS jamming), and reciprocal steps from Venezuela to shore up defenses and surveillance — a mix of signaling, deterrence, and information operations. The narrative frequently tied Venezuelan military facilities to drug‑trafficking accusations (’Cartel of the Suns’), which U.S. sources used to justify identifying targets, while Venezuela sought external patrons (Russia/China) and increased internal security controls.\n\nImportant data points & links (sources from this week):\n- Reports U.S. identified strike targets (airbases/ports) and possible imminent action: https://x.com/sentdefender/status/1984250342695964762, https://x.com/sentdefender/status/1984080245851365550\n- White House / Trump publicly deny strikes are being considered: https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1984315326595489826, https://x.com/sentdefender/status/1984291421344747796\n- U.S. Marines / 22nd MEU live‑fire operations in the Caribbean: https://x.com/sentdefender/status/1984070900552192476\n- USS Iwo Jima and escort movements near La Orchila: https://x.com/SA_Defensa/status/1984036402741526581\n- Significant GPS interference observed since Oct 29 over northern Venezuela and Trinidad & Tobago: https://x.com/sentdefender/status/1984308146458767630\n- Maduro reportedly appealed to Russia/China for defensive systems: https://x.com/SA_Defensa/status/1984322184441995697\n- Maduro launches citizen reporting/surveillance app: https://x.com/elpaisinenglish/status/1983866805778075904\n- Reports of Venezuelan F‑16 scramble from El Libertador: https://x.com/sentdefender/status/1983705601382478250\n\nBottom line: The week was defined by heightened military signaling and competing narratives — leaked reports of planned U.S. strikes and target lists, visible U.S. naval/Marine activity nearby, electronic interference over the northern coast, Caracas’ outreach for foreign defensive assistance and increased internal surveillance — producing regional tension and uncertainty about whether rhetoric would translate into kinetic action."
